<p>I just had another realization that you may want to consider.</p>
<p>I noticed that certain some people on the forum were never shown as <strong>Online</strong>, even when they clearly were, and others were shown as online at times. I then realized to myself there must be a way to never show your status as <strong>Online</strong>.</p>
<p>The way you do this is to open up <strong>Account Settings</strong> and unselect the box that says <strong>Show others my online status</strong>.</p>
<p>So why would you want to do this anyways? For reasons we spoke about earlier, you do not want to give any law enforcement the ability to see when you log on and log off. It is bad practice, it can leave a trail, leave a pattern, and if you are a person of interest and they are able to connect the time you sign off on the forum with the time you leave your house, or go to sleep, it gives them more reason to be suspicious and more evidence to be used against you in court.</p>
<p>Consider disabling this option.</p>
