<p>Market reviews are very important aspect of all market&#8217;s reputation and are crucial the way users &amp; vendors decide which markets to use, thats why we take them very seriously, so once and for all i decided to post a clear list of guidelines for posting market reviews.</p>
<p>Basically, your review <strong>MIGHT </strong>be deleted if it will contain <span style="text-decoration: underline;">anything but market review</span>, that means:</p>
<ol>
<li>If It will contain blatant advertising of some products (i.e post your vendor ad on several markets).</li>
<li>If you will post the same review more than once (even if the text is different).</li>
<li>If you will Shill = leave good reviews for yourself and bad for others. This is a very common reason for disapproval or deletion.</li>
<li>If you will Give a market low score because <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a vendor</strong></span> scammed you, doesn&#8217;t matter if you FE&#8217;d, stayed in escrow, or used multisig, its your problem, not the market.</li>
<li>If you will post any kind of personal information.</li>
<li>If you will post links to downloadable files.</li>
<li>If you will post non-darknet related contact info (ie. Skype , ICQ , Email etc).</li>
<li>If it will contain anything that will be suspected as scam service / site.</li>
<li>If it will contain anything that will be suspected as phishing &#8211; If you want to let us know about url changes or alternative urls, use the contact page.</li>
<li>If you will post referral links.</li>
<li>If you will leave low score because you got phished (In addition to having regular reports from reliable vendors and buyers, we test all markets on a regular basis from anonymous accounts to know if you can deposit / withdraw) so no point at leaving &#8220;Admins are scammers!!!11! i can&#8217;t login after deposit&#8221; or &#8220;EXIT SCAM!!!&#8221; reviews because <strong>YOU</strong> got phished, lost your password, PIN or whatever.</li>
<li>If you will post unrelated / unknown links to other sites / services.</li>
<li>If you will post more than one review in a row to add more info, they will be merged into one.</li>
</ol>
