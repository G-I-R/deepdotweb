<p>A Pretty idiotic article by Vice was making fun of some pretty nice pieces of artwork made by the alleged silk road mastermind Ross William Ulbricht  Aka.  Dread Pirate Roberts Aka DPR.</p>
<p>Well, the article itself is not really worth reading &#8211; but the art is worth presenting &#8211;</p>
<p>you can read the original article here if you really want to: [Silk Road Founder Ross William Ulbricht Is Good at the Internet but Bad at Art](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5gkppd/silk-road-founder-ross-william-ulbricht-is-good-at-the-internet-and-bad-at-art)</p>
<p>or we can save you the trouble and post the art here:</p>
