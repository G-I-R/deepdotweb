    This is an annotated transcript of the chapter &#8220;Your Crack’s in the Post&#8221; (pg219-244) &amp; an excerpt from the chapter &#8220;Prohibition in the Digital Age&#8221; (pg262), of Drugs 2.0: The Web Revolution That’s Changing How the World Gets High, Mike Power (2 May 2013); it is principally on the topic of Bitcoin, Tor, and Silk Road.

<p>Well you can say that again,  the information there is outdated for sure as it was written a while back &#8211; way before the unexpected shutdown, and most of the info is well known to any long term traveler, but it still is a nice nostalgia and a good read.</p>
<p>Read the whole chapter here:</p>
