<p><em>OCTOBER 21&#8211;One of the top narcotics dealers on Silk Road, the recently shuttered online drug bazaar, secretly began cooperating with federal agents after his Seattle-area home was raided in late-July, The Smoking Gun has learned.</em></p>
<p>One of the most known drugs dealers on silk road &#8211; Steven Sadler, known online as “Nod,” was flipped by the fed and started cooperating with them around july this year, a few month before he got arrested</p>
<p>Sadler’s cooperation was disclosed at a brief U.S. District Court hearing earlier this month, according to an official audiotape of the proceeding before Magistrate Judge Brian Tsuchida.</p>
<p>Further infomation about this issue was published in an article <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/silk-road-dealer-cooperating-567432" target="_blank">Here</a></p>
<p>This adds up to a post on reddit posted a week ago from a buyer claimed to have been raided by the FBI and the discussion suggested he was a customer of NOD:</p>
