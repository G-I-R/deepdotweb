<p>As was posted in more than one reddit thread:Â  &#8220;by degenerate vendors &#8211; fake Adderall (Pink AD 30 Shire knockoff), fake percocet (Endo 10mg knockoff), fake hydrocodone (Watson 853 yellow knockoff)&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Readdit post:</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Current vendor names: <strong>meandmypills, unknownseller, pepperidgefarm, Pharmington Rex, Cimicon,</strong></em></p>
<div>
<div>
<p><em>And any other selling the same pills.</em></p>
<p><em>They are indeed scammers selling fake pills. They have accounts on Sheep and BMR and SR 2.0. Expect to see them pop up under different names. They currently ship from the UK.</em></p>
<p><em>Fake Adderall with imprint -AD- on one side, 3|0 on the other (Contains methamphetamine, phentermine and caffeine) &#8211; This what they are selling: <a href="http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2830">http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2830</a></em></p>
<p><em>Fake Percocet &#8211; Compare to the real Endo Percocet: <a href="http://www.webmd.com/drugs/image.aspx?drugid=2796&amp;drugname=oxycodone-acetaminophen+Oral&amp;title=PERCOCET+10-650+MG+TABLET&amp;monoid=16590062030&amp;cb=mywebmd">http://www.webmd.com/drugs/image.aspx?drugid=2796&amp;drugname=oxycodone-acetaminophen+Oral&amp;title=PERCOCET+10-650+MG+TABLET&amp;monoid=16590062030&amp;cb=mywebmd</a></em></p>
<p><em>Pay close attention to the imprint of the real versus what they are selling. Notice the &#8220;10&#8221; on the real percocet looks like what is in quotes. On their pills, the number one is just a straight line and the zero is a rectangle and not an oval font.</em></p>
<p><em>Fake Hydrocodone &#8211; compare to the real Watson hydrocodone: <a href="http://www.drugs.com/imprints/watson-853-10141.html">http://www.drugs.com/imprints/watson-853-10141.html</a></em></p>
<p><em>Pay close attention to the fonts. Look at the number fonts on the real and compare it to the fake garbage these guys are selling.</em></p>
<p><em>Plus Watson Hydrocodones are now white. Not yellow with dark specks in it.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, for those of you that bought either of their opiate pills, simply break a piece off and crush it in you mouth using your front teeth. It will burn your tongue like an acid. Real opiates don&#8217;t do that. Do NOT swallow this but rinse your mouth out with water. Eat or drink something sweet to get rid of the aftertaste.</em></p>
<p><em>Help spread the word and save people from being scammed and possibly harmed by these unscrupulous, greedy sellers.</em></p>
<p><em>Post on market forums. Do NOT let these pills be sold. Report any vendor selling this garbage to market admins when you see listings.&#8221;</em></p>
