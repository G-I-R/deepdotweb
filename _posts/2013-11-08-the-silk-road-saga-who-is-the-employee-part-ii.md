<p>While the first Silk Road was still in operation, its illicit dealings brought about more crime than just the sale of drugs.  In fact, on one occasion, the leader of Silk Road, Dread Pirate Roberts, paid for the torturing and assassination of one of their own –“The Employee”.  In the first part of this series, the usernames of this individual were believed to have been ‘chronicpain’ and ‘flush’.  Not only does the timing of their original registration and last posts correlate with the staged capture and assassination of ‘The Employee’, but also, both chronicpain and flush had many of the same interests, backgrounds, and even writing styles.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, on the Tor network, not only is tracking down who-is-who, a very difficult proposition, but the uncovering of real world identities is next to impossible.  However, investigations into the true identity of ‘The Employee’ may have finally reached a suspect.</p>
<p>His names on Silk Road were chronicpain and flush, but his real world name is Curtis Green.  Green’s affinity for cards, chips, and opiates tell the story of who this man actually was: the man that Ross Ulbricht, DPR, thought he had killed.</p>
<p>Green’s game was poker.  In fact, he was apparently fond enough of the game that he played in professional poker tournaments.  Green even did somewhat well for himself during the 2010 World Series of Poker, as the one and only, Curtis Green, made the number 62 ranking, winning $2,742 –according to <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/poker/news/story?id=5261066" target="_blank">ESPN</a>.  Hence, Green’s choosing of the username: flush.</p>
<p>This, of course, makes sense, as Green often bragged on the Silk Road forum about his WSOP exploits, saying, &#8220;I have cashed in 2 WSOP events and many other events&#8221;.</p>
<p>In addition, Green’s Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/ilovepoker/status/397099350901276672" target="_blank"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d5b6b295bcb9baa3b0a5babeb0a7">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, last stated on November 3, saying, “Wow, I guess there are a lot of people that must have taken their tin foil hats off. Good grief&#8230;”</p>
<p>Green also had quite the liking for opiates, as chronicpain wrote posts, such as:</p>
<p>&#8220;Technically, an 80mg oxycontin is equal to 40mg of opana ER. TAKEN ORALLY!! Now, if you snort them, 40mg of opana is 2 or 3 times the strength vs a snorted 80mg oxy. IV its about 3-4 times the strength. Would you consider getting an oxycontin 80mg for 15 or 20 bucks? thats basically what you are paying if you buy an opana 40mg ER for around 60 bucks.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, Green ran his own transportation company in Spanish Forks, Utah, called <a href="http://www.manta.com/c/mm83qhj/anytime-airport-shuttle-l-l-c" target="_blank">Anytime Airport Shuttle LLC</a>.  On the <a href="https://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.lu/index.php?topic=2080.msg17492#msg17492">Silk Road forum</a>, he often talked about his shuttle company:</p>
<p>“Are you talking about a reshipping service or starting up a UPS/Fedex/USPS type business? It would take a hell of a lot more than a couple vans, you would have to have vans in every state. Look as usps, they lose money every year. I used to own a transportation company and as part of it would deliver lost luggage for airlines. I had 10 vehicles and that was for one smaller type metro type area.”</p>
<p><a href="https://gir.pub/deepdotweb/2013/11/08/now-its-official-curtis-clark-green-is-flush-chronicpain/" target="_blank">Green has now pleaded guilty</a> on Wednesday for attempting to distribute cocaine, and faces up to 40 years in prison –which is arguably better than the death sentence that his former boss tried to give him.</p>
