<p>Every time we think that we have seen just about everything we find another surprise, this time at the form of a plan to create a newspaper to report whats new on the silk road, a user under the name of &#8221; Raoul Duke &#8221; posted the following:</p>

<p>The idea, which is not bad i must say, seems to have some support from real world journalists such as the forum member EileenOrmsby owner of the blog allthingsvice.com:</p>

<p>And of couese the much needed support from the new Dread Pirate Roberts,  the new SR Admin:</p>

<p>The reactions on Reddit were a bit less enthusiastic ranging from:</p>
<p><em>That is going to be hilariously bad.</em></p>
<p>to:</p>

<p><em>It&#8217;s not a newspaper, it&#8217;s an advertising board. As if DPR2 is going to let anything negative about SR2 appear in a &#8220;publication&#8221; he de facto owns by funding it. Cheap.</em></p>
<p>And:</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><em>Bold move by an underdog. This unestablished franchise faces an uphill battle, but if the locker-room discussion pans out there might just be gold in the teams future.</em></p>
<p><strong>Here &#8211; We believe in a positive approach, this is a nice idea that can be used for harm reduction same as for publicity and outing scammers without the need to be in constant updated with all the stuff that&#8217;s going on the forums.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This of course, as long as its not being used to promote any &#8220;private&#8221; agendas.</strong></p>
