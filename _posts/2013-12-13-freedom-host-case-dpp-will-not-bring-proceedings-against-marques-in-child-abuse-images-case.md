<p><strong>As it was published today by RTE:</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;An Irishman, described by an FBI Special Agent as &#8220;the largest facilitator of child porn in the world&#8221;, has indicated he would plead guilty to the offences if he were prosecuted in Ireland.</em></p>
<p><em>However, the High Court was told this morning that the Director of Public Prosecutions will not bring proceedings against Eric Eoin Marques.</em></p>
<p><em>Mr Marques is alleged to be the owner and administrator of an anonymous hosting site known as Freedom Hosting.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as it concerns freedom hosting &#8211; never mind the outcome, we say, good riddance. unlike anonymous marketplacesÂ  <strong>CP IS NOT</strong> victimless crime and it <strong>IS NOT</strong> being done by consenting adults who can understand the risks. same for guns and carding.</p>
