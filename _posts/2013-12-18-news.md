<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but this seems to be on the front page of a certain newspaper. Apparently, this is what Lisa Depies and the press consider to be news.</p>
<p>It is good for maybe a Facebook post, but for an actual newspaper article&#8230;Really? Now if this is what they will put on the front page, I can&#8217;t imagine what other juicy contents await me.</p>
