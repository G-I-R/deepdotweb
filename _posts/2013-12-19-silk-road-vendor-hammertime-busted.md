<p>After a year long operation, as it was published <a href="http://www.kgw.com/news/Wash-county-tactical-police-conducting-3-dawn-raids-236190011.html" target="_blank">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>ALOHA, Ore. &#8212; Washington County Sheriff&#8217;s Office tactical officers raided three locations and arrested several [4] people in connection with a major drug investigation Tuesday. Detectives said the suspects stole people&#8217;s identities, created fake profiles and used a website called &#8220;Silk Road&#8221; to sell methamphetamine around the world in an online drug trafficking ring they operated from Aloha. A federal indictment said the suspects transported more than $500,000 in meth. According to investigators, the drugs were shipped through FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service. &#8230;&#8221;This is a very complex investigation that has taken us a year to investigate because we are dealing with Internet crimes and when the Internet is involved, people are using computer names,&#8221; said Sgt. Bob Ray with the Washington County Sheriff&#8217;s Office. &#8220;It&#8217;s very difficult, it&#8217;s a long process.&#8221; &#8230;Washington County detectives said they expect to make more arrests as the investigation continues. They are currently searching for suspect Donald Bechan, 39, who is shown in photo at left.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later on, the user <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/gwern" target="_blank">Gwern</a> posted on the reddit the following information:</p>
<blockquote><p>The group is identified as the seller &#8220;<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/243666993/silkroad-hammertime.htm" target="_blank">hammertime</a>&#8221; in the federal indictment; the indictment (3:13-cr-00596b-J0) is not yet available through PACER (likely tomorrow), but the <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/243666993/2013-12-17-kgw-silkroad-hammertime.mp4" target="_blank">news video segment</a> featured a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZlcbTZt.png" target="_blank">screenshot of the first page</a> identifying hammertime.</p></blockquote>
