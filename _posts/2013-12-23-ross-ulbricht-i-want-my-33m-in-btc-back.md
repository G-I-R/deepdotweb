<p>Wow. was defiantly not expecting this one.</p>
<p>So Ross pretty much admits he was running the Silk Road and wants hes money back now from the feds who seized it.</p>
<p>The Internet “pirate” accused of running the notorious illegal-drug-peddling Web site Silk Road claims that the feds are the real buccaneers — robbing him to the tune of $33.6 million worth of the encrypted, virtual currency bitcoin.</p>
<p>Ross Ulbricht — who was arrested in October for allegedly masterminding the mysterious “deep Web” site — recently filed legal papers in Manhattan federal court admitting he <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“has an interest as owner”</strong></span> of the more than 173,000 bitcoins the government seized through forfeiture from Silk Road.</p>
