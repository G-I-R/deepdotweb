<p>Well, cant say we didnt warn you, just a few days ago we reported that Flomarket has <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2014/01/02/warning-reports-of-flomarket-possible-scam-hack/">disabled all withdrawals</a> , and the comment from the admin that they are &#8220;hoping&#8221; to fix this issue,</p>
<p>The market probably got hacked like the few previous markets &#8211; or the situation now is that &#8220;i got hacked&#8221; is the best excuse for scamming. this way or another, if you will try to access the site you will get this message:</p>

<p>&#8220;Website has been shutted down</p>
<p>We got hacked! A vendor managed to withdraw all BTC&#8217;s from this site. If you want to contact me, do so via TorChat (ID: flolellhwzjcle6d).<br/>
    This is the end of FloMarket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Did anyone try to contact the owner? (not that this is going to help anyone)</p>
<p>This shutdown just adds up to a growing list of shutdowns (although not from same reasons in all cases): Silk road1, Atlantis, Sheep Marketplace, Tormarket, Black Market Reloaded And now Flomarket&#8230;</p>
<p>You can find the currently active markets at our <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2013/10/28/updated-llist-of-hidden-marketplaces-tor-i2p/">list of hidden marketplaces</a> &#8211; while Flomarket has moved to the &#8220;Dead / Scam Marketplaces&#8221; Section obviously.</p>
