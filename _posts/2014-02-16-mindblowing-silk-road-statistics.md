<p>A Great thread was just published on the Silk road 2.0 forums, showing statistic of the marketplace Best sellers items and vendor as it was crawled by one of the users:</p>
<p>He even put up a domain to see the data: <strong>http://twam2dcppennla6s.onion/  </strong>(must have JS enabled)</p>
<p>Link to the Op: http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=26644.0;topicseen</p>
<p>This the quote:</p>

<p>Hello Everybody!</p>
<p>I know timing isn&#8217;t best, but I&#8217;m here to tell you about my &#8220;just for fun&#8221; project, in which I spidered the whole Silk Road and I&#8217;m serving results in very user friendly charts about vendors and items. These charts display interesting numbers such as average feedback rating, total feedback, etc. The charts are also easily filterable and sortable. Simply, the site has all needed functionality for finding top vendors/products of your interest. The reason why I decided to do such site is because I missed such functionality on Silk Road. I understand they have lots of other stuff to do, especially nowadays</p>
<p>I hope spidering SR isn&#8217;t against policy or something. I&#8217;m doing this, because I like SR and I want to improve shopping experience for everyone   I use non aggressive spidering, so it doesn&#8217;t hurt SR in any way.</p>
<p>Last spidering was done between 2014-02-04 and 2014-02-09 so data are not exactly up-to-date. Data will be updated as soon as SR will run again.<br/>
    Also, since I obviously don&#8217;t have access to SR database, there might be differences between SR and my charts (some vendors/items might be missing), but I did my best to minimize such differences.</p>
<p>Requirements: The site is basically javascript app, so it won&#8217;t work with javascript disabled. I decided to go this way for best user experience. I can tell you the site is 100% safe for your browser, but it&#8217;s up to you to believe me. If the site gets positive feedback, I&#8217;ll also make non-javascript version.</p>
