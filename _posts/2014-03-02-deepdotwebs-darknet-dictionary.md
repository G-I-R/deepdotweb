<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Onionland</strong></span> &#8211; A general term to describe tor hidden services</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>OnionNet</strong></span> &#8211; First real IRC network designed for Onionland. All IRC ops are pedophiles though. Long history but not many people use it anymore.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Onion Routing</strong></span> &#8211; A technique for anonymous communication over a computer network. Messages are repeatedly encrypted and send through multiple network nodes. The process is comparable to peeling an onion, each node removes a layer of encryption uncovering routing instructions for the following layer.</p>
<p><u><strong>Onion patch</strong></u> &#8211;  A saying for using the dnms on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/drugs">/r/drugs</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>opDarknet</strong></span> &#8211; Campaign launched by Anonymous a couple years ago. Targeted child porn sites as well as Freedom Hosting.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Operation Onymous</strong></span> &#8211; A global crackedown on the darknet markets during November 2014, in which <a href="tag/operation-onymous/">many sites were seized and several people arrested.</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Optimus Crime/OC</strong></span> &#8211; Admin of HackBB.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>OPSEC</strong></span> &#8211; Operation Security. The process of protecting little pieces of data that could be grouped together to form a bigger picture, or expose your identity.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>OrBot</strong></span> &#8211; a mobile version of the tor router for Android. Can be found on the Google Play store. Designed to either work with it&#8217;s own browser, or can be set up to work as proxy for any system that supports it. Can also be used on a rooted device to provide a transparent proxy that will force all apps to use tor for connecting.</p>
<p><u><strong>OS</strong></u> &#8211;  Operating system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pastebin</strong></span> &#8211; A website used to store text for a certain period of time. It is popular on the deep web because it is an easy way to anonymously share information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Parallel construction</strong></span> &#8211; Parallel construction is a law enforcement process of building a parallel &#8211; or separate &#8211; evidentiary basis for a criminal investigation in order to conceal how the investigation began.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PGP/GPG</strong></span> &#8211; Pretty Good Privacy/ Gnu Privacy Guard. PGP was introduced in 1991, and was formalized with <b><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880">RFC 2440 and RFC</a></b><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880"> 4880</a>. Uses a combination of public-key and symmetric-key cryptography to ensure that messages can be delivered without a third party gaining access to the contents of the message. It also allows for a message to be signed so that the author of the message is indisputable. Many different algorithms can be used for the encryption, but the most commonly used methods are RSA for the public key crypto, and AES for the symmetric cypher. It is extremely important hat the public key of any party be fully verified in order to know that the message is being delivered to the correct recipient or is from the correct sender. Here we have a <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2013/11/11/pgp-tutorial-for-newbs-gpg4win/">simple usage guide for windows</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>P2P Escrow</strong></span> &#8211; Most commonly used to refer transactions using &#8216;P2SH&#8217; addresses as defined by BIP 016. A public key is provided by a seller, market, and vendor, and used to create an address which requires two of the three parties to sign in order to redeem. The buyer than pays to this address. Of extreme importance is the &#8216;redeemScript&#8217; which details the information needed to redeem funds send to the address, which is a hash of the redeemScript. The goal of this method is that no one party has enough information to take funds from these P2SH addresses. Even if the market is hacked or taken down, the funds cannot be seized, and a buyer and seller can, with the redeemscript, finalize a transaction outside of the market&#8217;s involvement if they choose to.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Phishing</strong></span> &#8211; the act of using social engineering techniques to get private information such as user names and passwords. An example would be to send out a message claiming to be from an administrator asking for a password, or setting up a fraudulent website that a looks to be well know market&#8217;s site in order to gain user name and password information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pidgin OTR</strong></span> &#8211; Secured instant messaging software Pidgin is a free and open source client that lets you organize and manage your different Instant Messaging (IM) accounts using a single interface. The Off-the-Record (OTR) plug-in designed for use with Pidgin ensures authenticated and secure communications between Pidgin users.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PIN Code</strong></span> &#8211; Personal Identification Number Code. Uses as a secondary validation method to protect against loss of funds if the username and password are discovered. Generally it is only asked for during transfer of funds to outside the market or to confirm and finalize orders.</p>
<p><u><b>PM / DM</b></u> &#8211;  Personal message/ DM: Direct message.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Processing Time</strong></span> &#8211; time required by a market or vendor in order to complete a transaction. Generally this involves waiting for sufficient confirmations on the blockchain to ensure a deposit has been met, or to run funds through a bitcoin mixer on the market. Also used to for time required by a vendor once getting a transaction to put the goods into the post.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project Black Flag</strong></span> &#8211; Market set up shortly after the fall of the original Silk Road. Widely suspected to be a scam, this was confirmed to be the case after a <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2013/10/30/project-black-flag-waves-the-white-flag/">short period of time</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Proxy</strong></span> &#8211; Unlike a VPN, a proxy is a service that only changes the IP address websites can see within your web browser, rather than on all applications on your computer.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RAT (Remote Administration Tool)</strong></span> &#8211; A piece of software that allows a remote operator to control a system as if he has physical access to that system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RC (Research chemicals)</strong></span> &#8211; From wikipedia, Research Chemical are chemical substances used by scientists for medical and scientific research purposes. One characteristic of a research chemical is that it is for laboratory research use only. A research chemical is not intended for human or veterinary use.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Resolution</strong></span> &#8211; Used when there is a dispute between a buyer and seller. This usually involves whatever market used to serve as an arbitrator to determine how funds are to be released from escrow.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Reviews</strong></span> &#8211; the corpus of feedbacks left on a site, along with more information information gained by outside channels. Used by buyers to determine if they should take a vendor or buyer as legitimate.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Riseup / Safe-mail</strong></span> &#8211; Excellent e-mail services.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ross Ulbricht</strong></span> &#8212; Accused of the FBI of being the sole owner of the pseudonym &#8216;Dread Pirate Roberts&#8217; and creator of the Silk Road. He was an Eagle Scout and in a known libertarian. The original Silk Road website went down after his arrest.</p>
<p><u><strong>RTS</strong> </u>&#8211; Return to sender.</p>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Shadow Web</b></span> &#8211; A <b>mythical</b> part of the dark web that&#8217;s been perpetuated by creepypastas. Supposedly allows you to access an even darker network containing red rooms and cannibalism forums.</div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Same Same But Different (SSBD)</strong></span> &#8211;  Peter Phillip Nash,  Was arrested and accused in Australia for being on the Silk Road moderators You can read the full details about the moderators bust <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2013/12/21/silk-road-adminsmods-ssbd-libertas-inigo-arrested/">in this post.</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Samples</strong></span> &#8211; In the context of a market, a free or low cost item sent to a well known buyer in order to establish legitimacy. This proves that at least the seller has access to a product and is capable of delivering it in as secure way. The receiving party is expected to leave public feedback regarding the quality of the products and how well it&#8217;s been packaged.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong></span> &#8211; A pseudonym of the person or group of people who created Bitcoin and anonymously published its source code.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shared Send</strong></span> &#8211; A free method to tumble Bitcoins provided by blockchain.info. It routes transactions through a shared wallet breaking the chain of transactions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Scammer</strong></span> &#8211; One who would attempt to defraud either a vendor or seller. For a vendor this can take the form of simply not ever sending products, sending poor quality or misrepresented products, or &#8216;selective scamming&#8217; (See other entry).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Selective Scamming</strong></span>&#8211; Where known individuals are send product but large transactions or those from unknowns are not sent out. For a seller, this will mean that they claim to have not received goods that were delivered or that the goods were of poor quality/misrepresented.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Search (ability you must have)</strong></span> = <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=search">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=search</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sheep</strong> </span>&#8211; Second big online market to fail. Vendors flocked to the site citing it&#8217;s well polished vending design, and users followed. Disappeared without a trace <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2013/11/30/sheep-marketplace-scammed-over-40000000-in-the-biggets-darknet-scam-ever/">taking all funds in escrow with it</a>. Despite the manhunt that followed, it remains unclear if it was a deliberate scam, a result of being hacked, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shipping</strong></span> &#8211; Process of a vendor packaging and sending goods. A source of extreme difficulty for vendors, and how many have been caught. Ideal methods will appear be legitimate business to individual packages and correspondence. It is considered poor form to disclose any specifics of a shipment made, as it could be used to target a vendor.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shilling</strong></span> &#8211; Creating accounts on Reddit / Forums for the sole intention of posting Positive / Negative post about someone or something while trying to make them look authentic.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Silk Road</strong></span> &#8211; &#8216;The ebay of illegal goods&#8217;. First reported to a wide audience by Gawker 2011-06-01, it flourished due to a large vendor and user base, and strict controls to weed out scammers. Taken down after the arrest of Ross Ulbricht at the start of October, 2013. While it was not the first nor the last market for illegal items, none have matched it&#8217;s popularity and trust level given by vendors and users.</p>
<div><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SIGAINT</span> &#8211; </b>Tor-based <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2015/02/16/interview-sigaint-darknet-email-admin/">darknet email service</a> that allows you to send email without revealing your location or identity.  Its name is derived from SIGINT (&#8220;Signals Intelligence&#8221;), which refers to intelligence-gathering by interception of signals.</div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Silk Road 2.0</strong></span> &#8211; The successor of the first Silk Road. Was seized during <a href="tag/operation-onymous/">Operation Onymous</a>, and Blake Benthall the alleged admin of the site (Defcon) was arrested.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SMAC</strong></span> &#8211; a tool that can change your MAC address</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SMS4Tor</strong> </span>&#8211; Self-destructing messages. Similar to Privnote but for Tor. I prefer this because it&#8217;s an onion address AND does not require javascript (Privnote requires JS). You type out a message on their site, create a custom link, and share it to another user. The link will only work once, and so whoever opens it first is the only one who can read it. A great alternative to PGP as it is much more user-friendly. Very secure when  combined with PGP encryption. *This one&#8217;s a little harder to find but if you google &#8220;self destruct message tor&#8221; you should be able to find it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Stats (Buyer)</strong></span> &#8211; statistics used to determine legitimacy of buyers/sellers. Common are number of successful transactions, average reviews, and dollar amounts of successful transactions in total. These are usually imprecise in order to avoid anybody being profiled.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Stealth</strong></span> &#8211; Methods used by vendors during packaging to make them blend in with normal mail. Disclosing any particular method of stealth is considered extremely poor form. Examples of stealth methods include making the item appear to come from a legitimate, known business; hiding the product in another, nondescript looking item; and using moisture barrier bags or mylar to eliminate product odor from being emitted from the package. Ideally, you would be able to open the item and give a cursory inspection of all the contents and find nothing unusual, but in practice this can vary greatly.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sub Reddits</strong></span> &#8211; one of the subforums from the popular reddit.com community. Many times shortened to r/subredditname in common discussion. A team of administrators that are usually not affiliated with reddit determines the content policy of the sub reddit, with the website taking a very hands off approach.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SQL injection</strong></span> &#8211; An database code injection technique, used to attack data driven applications in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution, many markets got shut down or lost their money because of this type of attack.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tails</strong> </span>&#8211; Are you using just Tor Browser Bundle? Then consider TAILS, it&#8217;s an operating system specially made for anonymous activities that you boot from a CD or usb stick. It leaves no traces on your computer and has plenty of built in tools that come in handy.  *Check out their website, search &#8220;Tails boum&#8221; and you should find it very easily.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Talk.masked/core.onion</strong></span> &#8211; 2 of the first major forums in Onionland besides Onionforum.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Marketplace (i2p)</strong></span> &#8211; Market set up on the I2P network. Defined by use of an alternate anonymity network and the use of P2SH addresses to hold all funds in escrow during the ordering process. Tends to be either praised for its security or derided for the bugs and non-intuitiveness that it&#8217;s model provides. You can find full usage guide <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p/">here</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tony76</strong></span> &#8212; Was a trusted vendor on SR1, than ran a massive &#8220;FE&#8221; scam you can read the full story <a href="http://allthingsvice.com/2012/05/30/the-great-420-scam/">here</a>, The FBI accuses DPR of placing a hit on the individual using this pseudonym. He scammed a large number of Silk Road users, but his true identity and the details of if he was killed or not are still in dispute.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tor</strong></span> &#8211; The Onion Router. Uses &#8216;onion routing&#8217; to provide anonymous access to the Internet by encrypting a message several times with each relay removing one layer before the final destination is reached. Funded heavily by the US government, it&#8217;s security has been a focus of much academic research with no serious known issues or backdoors that have been discovered yet. Used by journalists, government censors, and more to hide their true location and identity.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Torchat</strong></span> &#8211; IM service that works by having each user set up a &#8216;hidden service&#8217; that can be used to contact them via Tor. Somewhat similar in purpose to OTR, but messages do not have plausible deniability.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Torch</strong></span> &#8211; Tor Search Engine (http://xmh57jrzrnw6insl.onion/) is your light in the dark net. Make sure to bookmark it if you want to wander the depths beyond your favorite markets.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tormarket</strong></span> &#8211; Another market to rise <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2013/12/23/reports-tormarket-scam-in-progress/">and fall</a> after SR&#8217;s demise. Not as big as Sheep, but the timing made many very cautious about the reliability of new markets.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tormail</strong></span> &#8211; Tor Mail was a Tor hidden service that allowed to send and receive email anonymously, to email addresses inside and outside the Tor network. The service was seized by the FBI as part of the Freedom Hosting bust in August 2013.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tor Browser Bundle (TBB)</strong></span> &#8211; A modified version of Firefox that allows people to easily use the Tor anonymity network. It is compatible with Windows, OS X, and Linux.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tor Exit Node</strong></span> &#8211; The last relay that data traveling from its originator (a computer) to the recipient (a web server) travels through before reaching the recipient. To the recipient, traffic appears to originate from the exit node.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tor Node</strong></span> &#8211; A data relay, either a connection point, a redistribution point (middle node), or an endpoint (exit node).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TS/LS/OPVA/pthc/PB/ptsc/petersburg/anything relating to a child/swirlface/<a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a9dbe9d0cec6c5cd">[email&#160;protected]</a></strong></span> &#8211; AVOID. CP keywords.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tumble</strong></span> &#8211; a method to anonymize the source of your bitcoins.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TrueCrypt</strong> </span>&#8211; Open source application used to encrypt storage devices such as hard drives and USB flash drives. It is also used to create encrypted virtual disks contained in a file that mount similarly to real storage devices.</p>
<p><u><strong>Tx ID</strong></u> &#8211; Bitcoin transaction ID</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Utopia marketplace</strong></span> &#8211; Market that had some connection to BMR (altho the nature of the connection is somewhat unclear). Had the advantage of being fully stocked with former BMR vendors at its public launch. Rapidly <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2014/02/11/utopia-marketplace-seized-by-dutch-police/">taken down by the Dutch police</a> not long after it was <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2014/02/03/utopia-marketplace-is-now-officialy-open/">unveiled to the public</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors</strong></span> &#8211; Those who sell product on a market. This may be of an illegal nature, semi-legal nature, or completely legal nature. Because a vendor will be given a buyer&#8217;s full information to send the product to, any new vendor is under heavy scrutiny of being a scam or a &#8216;honeypot&#8217; set up by law enforcement. Because of the difficult nature of the work, quality vendors tend to develop a cult following.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors Roundtable</strong></span> &#8211; A vendor only discussion forum on Silk Road 1/2 forums. Used on a site to allow vendors to bring up issues about the market or buyers without raising alarm in the general populace.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>VPN</strong></span> &#8211; <a title="Is your VPN Legit or Shit?" href="2014/07/08/is-your-vpn-legit-or-shit/">Virtual Private Network</a>. In the context of anonymous activity, this is usually a proxy that purports to be anonymous in nature to hide the end user&#8217;s identity. Generally either used to hide the fact that one is connecting to a anonymous network like Tor, or to hide the fact one is using an anonymous network like Tor (as many websites will block Tor outproxies). A VPN does not provide true security as there is no way to know if the operator is keeping logs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Whonix</strong></span> &#8211; (http://zo7fksnun4b4v4jv.onion) is an Debian based operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and security by isolation. Whonix consists of two parts: One solely runs Tor and is called Gateway. The other, the Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only connections through Tor are possible.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Whistleblowing</strong></span> &#8211; The disclosure by a person, usually an employee in a government agency or private enterprise, to the public or to those in authority, of mismanagement, corruption, illegality, or some other wrongdoing.</p>
