<p>Due to the recent events of silk road being hacked and all the other technical problems &#8211; along with the common belief that silk road is not a safe marketplace to us, the well known <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/silkroad">Silk road Sub reddit</a> is no more!</p>
<p>For the past week or so the moderators debated privately if they should privatize the sub in order to force users into trying other markets that are probably safer and more functional than the current state of silk road. if you will try to access the silk road sub now, you will be redirected to the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/">Darknetmarkets</a> sub Reddit:</p>

<p>The silk road sub Reddit was without a doubt the most active sub Reddit any marketplace ever had, and was the most useful resource outside the silk road forums, this is how it looked like:</p>

<p>Its a shame to is it gone. This is the official statement from the mods and can be found in this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1zerem/rsilkroad_is_now_restricted_welcome_to/</p>

<blockquote><p>For those of you who are subscribed to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad" rel="nofollow">/r/SilkRoad</a> and now see redirect screen to this subreddit, we at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets" rel="nofollow">/r/DarkNetMarkets</a> want to welcome you here.</p>
<p>This was not an easy decision for anyone. We talked it out, <strong>and it was decided that in order to discourage use of SilkRoad 2.0</strong>, we would change the subreddit to restricted and redirect users to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets" rel="nofollow">/r/DarkNetMarkets</a>. We believe that SilkRoad is a dying brand that Ross Ulbricht would be ashamed of now. The site has been compromised since before Ross was ever arrested, and is now only a shadow of what is used to be.</p>
<p>For those of you who were loyal to the SilkRoad brand, we hope that you will check out one of the many, many sites that are located in our sidebar. If you will do a little bit of diligent research, you&#8217;ll find which market and what vendors suit your needs.</p>
<p>We have retained all information that was on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad" rel="nofollow">/r/SilkRoad</a>. If you go to the sub and uncheck the &#8220;use subreddit style&#8221; option, you&#8217;ll be able to see the sub as it normally looks. However, new posts are not allowed. The sub is now for information and historical purposes only.</p>
<p>We hope to see many new subscribers at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets" rel="nofollow">/r/DarkNetMarkets</a>, and we hope you&#8217;ll feel comfortable being a part of our community. We are constantly working on ways to make this subreddit conducive not only to safety and learning, but to fun as well.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to comment here. Thanks!</p></blockquote>

<p>For now, we wish all the Silk Road redditors to enjoy their new and Quality home at the DarkNetMarkets sub reddit and good luck to the DNM sub mods with the large amount of traffic they are about to handle.</p>
