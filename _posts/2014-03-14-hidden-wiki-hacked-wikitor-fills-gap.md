<p><strong><em>Wikitor can be found at this url: http://wikitor74em2u6rq.onion</em></strong></p>
<div id=":4fc"><wbr />The Hidden Wiki was hacked and had is private key stolen earlier this week and received a strange response: positivity and applause! The hidden service was a Tor directory of any link from adverts for drugs/guns/hackers/assassins to forums sharing child pornography.</div>
<p>While the majority of links were accepted while perhaps frowned upon, it was the links to child abuse that didn&#8217;t sit well with the majority. Rumors of promoted links for well known scammers was also not going down well with visitors. So it was perhaps no surprise to see positive responses to the site being taken down.</p>
<p>The hidden wiki url &#8211; kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion now redirects to a new hidden wiki after being redirected to DOXBIN for a while  (http://doxbinicsjqqmohl.<wbr />onion/thw.php) who credited <a href="https://twitter.com/queefyyy" target="_blank">Queefyyy</a> with the attack. The <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/OneTrueDoxbin" target="_blank">DOXBIN</a>  claim to have instigated the attack with Queefyyy:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550">
<p>In 1 move, I did more to limit CP access than all the Twitter pedo hunters of the last 3 years. What have you done today?</p>
<p>&mdash; DOXBIN (@OneTrueDoxbin) <a href="https://twitter.com/OneTrueDoxbin/statuses/443466804875513856">March 11, 2014</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We don&#8217;t know if this is as a results of some agreement between the hacker and the hidden wiki owners to clean things up and get the private keys in return, or just someone who used the hidden wiki private key to create a cleaner mirron of the hidden wiki.</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="https://twitter.com/LOIC_Squad" target="_blank">LOIC</a>, with connections to Anonymous and Lulz, also claim the move was thanks to their group for the attack on the hidden wiki:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">You guys want to contact Jesus? The man of the house? <a href="https://twitter.com/Queefyyy">@Queefyyy</a> is the brains for the attack. Fuck all you faggots claimin our shit.</p>
<p>&mdash; LOIC (@LOIC_Squad) <a href="https://twitter.com/LOIC_Squad/status/444330351385538560">March 14, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>What is clear is that Queefyyy hacked into The Hidden Wiki&#8217;s server and took the private key (which can be found at this url on the DOXBIN site: http://doxbinicsjqqmohl.<wbr />onion/misc/THW_private_key.txt<wbr />) for their domain name. Anyone with this private key can take over the domain and host it elsewhere, he also released a full zip backup file of what used to be the Hidden Wiki:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550">

<p>What we have found as a potential candidate to take the hidden wiki&#8217;s place as a more friendly Tor directory is what The Hidden Wiki should have been all along and it goes by the name of WikiTor (http://wikitor74em2u6rq.onion<wbr />):</p>
<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2014/03/wikitor.png" />

<p>It is very thorough with a discussion page for each category allowing anyone to suggest new links or discuss existing links. This allows for scammers to be reported and investigated, while also allowing new websites to have their sites verified and added. What we like about this site is the frequent moderation of the links. All known scams and child porn links are not present and there are plenty of links to forums where you can investigated someone before doing business with them.</p>
<p>The site is still young, and need to filled with more links, but the direction its going and the impression we had from its owners seems positive enough to gain our initial support for this project, with the hope that they will remain  honest and clean from all the stuff we did not want to see on the hidden wiki.</p>
<p>The DNM community also appears to be behind the site with DarkNetMarkets (https://pay.reddit.com/r/<wbr />DarkNetMarkets/comments/<wbr />204otx/the_hidden_wiki_is_<wbr />dead_long_live/), a well respected sub-Reddit for trading on Tor, offering their support.</p>
<p>With signs of a strong ethic (at least as far as Tor activity goes), we hope to see WikiTor:  <strong>http://wikitor74em2u6rq.onion</strong> around for many years. we will be following and updating for new developments, if any.</p>
