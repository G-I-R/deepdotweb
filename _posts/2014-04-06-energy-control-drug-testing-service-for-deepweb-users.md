<p>We Are happy to introduce a new service, introduced to us and endorsed by <a href="https://gir.pub/deepdotweb/2014/03/26/doctorx-ask-drug-expert-physician-thread-now-hub-forums/">DoctorX</a> (Dr. Fernando Caudevilla, a Spanish Physician who has been offering professional advice about Drugs and Health during the last year in Silk Road1 / Silk Road2 &amp; The Hub Forums) Offering International drug testing services in spain directed at DeepWeb users and accepting BTC payments,</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This is the information he sent us to publish about this service:</strong></span></p>
<p>Energy Control (www.energycontrol.org) established in Barcelona in 1997 as a pioneer project in Spain in the area of reducing the risks associated with recreational drug use, having since received recognition from numerous government administrations (European, state, community and local).</p>
<p>We offer a Drug Checking Service in order to inform the users about the composition of the drugs and thus advise on lower risk consumption.</p>
<p><a href="http://energycontrol.org/files/analisis/Annual_Drug_Checking_Report_Energy_Control_2011.pdf">http://energycontrol.org/files/analisis/Annual_Drug_Checking_Report_Energy_Control_2011.pdf</a></p>

<p>We also offer customized, non-moralistic and scientific drug information directed to drug users. The Drug Checking Service has operated in Spain since 1999 and now will also be offered internationally. We believe that Online Deep Web Drug Markets are an emerging trend and we want to spread our preventive work there, from a risk reduction perspective.</p>
<p>Energy Control provides an analysis service with the two most powerful analytical techniques available to analyze drug samples: Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS and Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS)</p>
<p>The service includes detection and quantification (%). We can test samples of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cocaine and its usual adulterants: levamisole, phenacetine, acetaminophen, caffeine, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine and benzocaine</li>
<li>Heroin, codeine and morphine</li>
<li>Amphetamine, methamphetamine and 4-metylamphetamine</li>
<li>MDMA, MDA, MDEA and adulterants: dextromethorphan, m-CPP, metoclorpramide, PMA and PMMA.</li>
<li>LSD</li>
<li>DMT, NMT, harmine, harmaline, THH and gramine.</li>
<li>2C-B</li>
<li>Methylone, butylone and mephedrone.</li>
<li>Cannabinoids (only THC y CBD)</li>
</ul>
<p>Consult for analysis of other substances not listed above.</p>
<p>The standard price for analysis and quantification is 50 EUR. We only accept Bitcoin as payment method. Estimated time for giving results is 7-10 days after receiving the sample in Spain. In case we do not receive your sample (lost, seized in customs…) we would send your money back.</p>
<p>All profits of this service are set aside for maintenance of this project</p>
<p>Anonymity and confidentiality are guaranteed during all the process. We do not share any information with anyone except users and e-mails are destroyed after finishing the process.</p>
<p>This project counts on the help of DoctorX (Dr. Fernando Caudevilla), an active member in some Deep Web forums, where he has been offering information and customized advice about drugs and risk reduction during last year.</p>
