<p>Remember the service we have reported about last week? <a href="https://gir.pub/deepdotweb/2014/04/30/dnstats-darknetmarkets-uptime-monitor/">Dnstats – DarkNetMarkets Uptime Monitor</a> a service providing an overview of the marketplaces uptime status, so you can know at anytime if:</p>
<p>1.Market &#8220;x&#8221; down now?</p>
<p>2. Market “x” back up yet?</p>
<p>3. Is it down for everyone or just me?</p>
<p>4. Which marketplaces tend to be down more than others?  (being attacked? busy?)</p>
<p>5. For us – its a n easy way to check and clean dead markets from <a href="https://gir.pub/deepdotweb/2013/10/28/updated-llist-of-hidden-marketplaces-tor-i2p/" target="_blank">our marketplace list</a>.</p>
<p>Wellת now there is no need to look any further. thanks to the Dnstat creator, we have implemented a widget on the sidebar &#8211; showing at any given time the markets Uptime status and updating every 15 minutes. so no need to refresh the market every 2 minutes to know if its back, here it is:</p>
