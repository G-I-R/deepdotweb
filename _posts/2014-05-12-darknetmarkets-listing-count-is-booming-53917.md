<p>Just two weeks ago we posted a study that <a href="https://gir.pub/deepdotweb/2014/04/30/darknetmarkets-listing-count-is-booming-approaching-50000/">compared</a> the listing count of the DarkNetMarkets the total listing count in the first Silk Road,</p>
<p>Today,  it appears that a user &#8211; <a class="author may-blank id-t2_f7i7s" href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Dunavo">Dunavo</a> just made a count of all the listings across the marketplaces &#8211; and published it in this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/25cmt7/leaderboard/">reddit thread</a> Remember that this is <strong>NOT</strong> the number of unique products listings &#8211; but the total amount of listing (we never had a situation of just unique listing so this shouldn&#8217;t matter anyway) but it still gives a great deal of information about the market size in compare to what we used to know in the past. The listing count at the various marketplaces is as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Some insights about the markets just by looking at these numbers:</strong></p>
<p><a href="marketplace-directory/listing/evolution-marketplace">Evolution</a> &#8211; is indeed <a href="https://gir.pub/deepdotweb/2014/05/10/evolution-marketplace-staff-speak-we-are-growing-fast/">Growing fats</a> (taking its place as the third largest market)</p>
<p><a href="marketplace-directory/listing/pandora-market">Pandora</a> &amp; <a href="marketplace-directory/listing/silk-road-2-0">Silk Road</a> &#8211; Did not crash after being &#8220;hacked&#8221; but kept growing. &#8211; <a href="https://gir.pub/deepdotweb/2014/03/20/pandora-hacked-losing-50-btc/">Pandora Hack</a>  &#8211; <a href="https://gir.pub/deepdotweb/2014/02/13/silk-road-2-hacked-bitcoins-stolen-unknown-amount/">Silk Road 2 Hacked</a></p>
<p><a href="marketplace-directory/listing/hydra-marketplace">Hydra</a> &#8211; Being popular as its the newest market out of the 7 largest markets. (there is also <a href="marketplace-directory/listing/andromeda-market">Andromeda</a> but it was <a href="https://gir.pub/deepdotweb/2014/05/01/marketplace-merge-darkbay-andromeda/">merged</a> with Darkbay &#8211; what probably counts in the listing count)</p>
<p><a href="marketplace-directory/listing/the-marketplace-i2p">The Marketplace</a> &#8211; Still growing slow and has a policy of one listing per product per vendor &#8211; which means that it had higher count if he was operating in the same policy as the other markets.</p>
