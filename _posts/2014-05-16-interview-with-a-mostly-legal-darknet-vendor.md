<p>As the end of our &#8220;interviews season&#8221; is approaching &#8211; meaning, i am going to stop doing them soon, its too much time consuming and i think we have heard almost everything by now, We can sum up that So far we had the chance to talk with the illegal side of the DNM scene &#8211;  <a href="?s=interview">Vendors, Market admins, Money launderers and others&#8230;</a> But there is also Other type of vendors that is selling normal and <strong>mostly </strong>(yes, except the carding part&#8230;) legal stuff on the deep web and i was always wondering why they would do that and no go and sell those items on the clearnet where there is much more traffic? So we had a chat with one of the top &#8220;digital products&#8221; sellers on Agora &#8211; a vendor named &#8220;Fake&#8221; a former top seller on <a href="marketplace-directory/listing/black-market-reloaded-bmr">BMR</a> with a history on <a href="marketplace-directory/listing/agora-market">Agora</a> of 300~500 sales and feedback score of  <span class="gen-user-ratings">4.75/5</span></p>

<p>We wanted to see what she has to say:</p>
<p><strong>Who are you and what do you do? (as in DNM&#8217;s)</strong><br />
    Hi, i am the top seller &#8220;fake&#8221; (yes this is my ID:) , i was the largest seller on BMR, and i am the largest on Evo , i am on Agora too. I have a very large number of listings, many are carding and hacking tutorials, but i also deal anonymous visas, fresh verified paypal accounts, electronics, and much more. I am one of the rare women selling on deep web (I think).</p>
<p><strong> Can you tell me a bit about yourself as a vendor? I just saw you are selling mostly electronic products on Agora And have some good ratings</strong><br />
    I am a top seller, i like to have 100% satisfied customers, and i offer full refund if they are not , i like to find solutions with them, and i am very reasonable and calm, this is the reason of my success. Many customers are recurring buyers, many follow me since BMR (Black Market Reloaded). I like to find objects or ebooks that could be interesting for the deep web users.</p>
<p><strong> Since most of your products are legal anyway &#8211; Why not selling those items on Clearnet?<br />
</strong>Deep web take a lot of my time, and i do not need to deal on clearnet , but now im going to open a personal shop on deep web, so if markets goes down , buyers can continue to buy from my on my site. Also, i never said that ALL my products are legal, in some country they can&#8217;t be legal. I like deep web because i like bitcoin and privacy, it is an emerging market, and i am ready to ride it.</p>
<p><strong> When Did you star selling?<br />
</strong>I started selling when BMR started, i was one of the first seller there, before i was a seller on ebay since 1998 , but now i am only on deep web because paypal banned me .</p>
<p><strong>On which markets people can find you?<br />
</strong>Agora and Evolution</p>
<p><strong> Which markets did you vend on in the past?<br />
</strong>BMR, SR , Tormarket , Utopia</p>
<div class="im"><strong>Did you lose money one Tormarket / Utopia &#8211; if so, how much?<br />
</strong>I lost around 2k usd on SR , and some little amount on other markets.</div>
<p><strong> What made you want to do an interview, publicity?<br />
</strong>Not exactly, but if this happen, why not? I think it will raise my popularity on deep web.</p>
<p><strong>And you say &#8211; &#8220;Not exactly&#8221;  so what do you mean by increasing your popularity?<br />
</strong>I am a little egocentric and i like when other people send me a PM telling me that i am great, i am the best and so on, and i like that everyone on the deepweb know my id.</p>
<p><strong> Can you estimate how much do you make vending and which market is the best seller?<br />
</strong>When i was on BMR i was always in the top page because i was the big seller, this gave me a lot of visibility and i was doing around 400 usd a day. Now i gain around 200 usd daily from Agora and Evolution Both are good markets for me, probably i deal a little much on Agora , but i prefer Evolution, because it is really a fast and easy to use market, with great support, probably the best ever seen.</p>
<p><strong> Whats your best tip to avoid scamming buyers &amp; Your best tip for buyers to avoid scamming vendors?<br />
</strong>I offer full refund if buyer are not satisfied and provide me a reasonable claim. It is hard for a buyer to scam a trusted vendor like me, admins are not stupid.</p>
<p><strong> Did you have any experiences with LE or suspected LE while vending on the markets?<br />
</strong>Absolutely not, my deals are barely legal, i do not deal drugs , firearms or other heavy illegal things, anyway, many times i get questions from buyer trying to involve me in heavy illegal activity, i always reject these proposals, and sometimes i doubt they are LE, but i can&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><strong>You think that because you sell electronic products you get less attention from LE or maybe more attention since some are carding products?</strong><br />
    My electronics are all legal.</p>
<p><strong>What are your top selling products?<br />
</strong>My best sellers are verified paypal accounts and carding tutorials</p>
<p><strong>Can you share some interesting experiences you have encountered while vending? (with buyers, market admins, other vendors etc<br />
</strong>One buyer was asking me help to cashout his personal offshore bank account with 5m usd. One paranoid buyers ask me for an helmet to prevent LE to spy his thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Anything else you would like to add?</strong><br />
    I will say that i am a gentle lady with 2 children&#8217;s  to grow alone, i work hard every day , but my wage isn&#8217;t much, and i this is the first reason why i entered the deep web businness. Some buyer think that because we are on the deep he can write without respect, i disagree.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>There were some more question i wanted to ask Fake, but since it was trough the mail and not IM, and both of us are not native English speakers &amp; it seemed that the time differences between us were quite big, it was too exhausting &#8211; so i decided to keep it short this time. I would like to thank Fake for taking the time and answering those questions, if you need more info you can always find him on <a href="marketplace-directory/listing/agora-market">Agora</a> and <a href="marketplace-directory/listing/evolution-marketplace">Evo</a> under the name &#8220;Fake&#8221;.</p>
