<p>Hey everyone! First off, thanks a lot to everyone at DeepDotWeb for allowing me to make this and many more posts to come! I really hope everyone on the website finds it useful! So, on to the tutorial. Tor, as we all know, Tor is a network that uses peer-to-peer connections. These connections from one person to another are very strongly encrypted, not only allowing people to securely go to websites without leaving a trace of who they are, but they allow people to encrypt everyday internet connections. Today, I will be focusing the main part of today’s tutorial on connecting to IRC networks via Tor. Keep in mind, I will be explaining this from complete start to end as if you are just learning about what Tor is.</p>

<p>The first thing you are going to need is obviously the latest version of Tor from the Tor website. It’s going to download an exe file for you to open and extract. Go ahead, and extract the files to a place where you are going to have easy access to it. I personally extract all the files to a folder on my Desktop so I can get to it at any time.</p>

<p>With that, I once again thank DeepDotWeb for allowing me to write for them, and I thank you the reader for reading this tutorial. I hope this helps you as much as it helps me, weather you are brand new to the use of Tor, or an old user such as myself!</p>
