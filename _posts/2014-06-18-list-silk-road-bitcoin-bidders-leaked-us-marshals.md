<blockquote><p>A list of potential buyers for almost 30,000 bitcoins confiscated from the now-defunct Silk Road black marketplace has been leaked via email by the US Marshals Service (USMS).</p>
<p>The original intent of the email was to inform interested parties about an updated <a href="http://www.usmarshals.gov/assets/2014/bitcoins/" target="_blank">FAQ related to the bitcoin auction</a>. The USMS staffer who sent the email allegedly inadvertently CC’ed the list rather than BCC’ed, making the names viewable for all recipients.</p>
<p>The list details a diverse group of possible bidders representing members of the bitcoin community and the investment world, as well as varied private citizens.</p>
<p>The list of names includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rowan.edu/colleges/business/facultystaff/moreinfo.cfm?id=639" target="_blank">Daniel Folkinshteyn</a>, assistant professor at Rowan University</li>

</ul>
<p>Additional emails from the USMS provided to CoinDesk state that the names are only those who have expressed interest in the auction.</p>
<p>The email, allegedly from the US government, explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>“One of the emails that we sent out this morning inadvertently showed a list of some of the individuals who have asked a question or questions about the pending bitcoin auction. We apologize for the error.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Notably, the email address which sent the original message to potential buyers was the same the USMS required bidders to use when sending information to be considered.</p></blockquote>
