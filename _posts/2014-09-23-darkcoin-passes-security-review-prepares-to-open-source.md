<p>A Press release by the <a href="https://darkcointalk.org/threads/possible-darkcoin-press-release-rc5-open-source-instant-transactions-kristov-code-review.2399/">Darkcoin community</a>:</p>
<p>Security researcher Kristov Atlas has concluded his code review and security audit of <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2014/05/20/the-rise-of-darkcoin/">Darkcoin</a>. He was solicited by the developers of Darkcoin, based on 4+ years of professionally reviewing C/C++ software, to review the code and suggest any changes which could improve the software. Kristov Atlas concluded that Darkcoin&#8217;s claims of functional anonymity are well-founded. He did suggest a few concerns, which the Darkcoin team immediately fixed (the fixes will be released <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1091700750"><span class="aQJ">Monday</span></span> as part of the next scheduled update to the Darkcoin client). Mr. Atlas&#8217; primary concern was that a bad actor could launch a so-called Sybil attack against the network. Evan Duffield, lead developer of Darkcoin, closed this potential attack vector and in doing so also found a way to increase the overall anonymity of Darkcoin transactions.</p>

<p>The new update to Darkcoin, &#8220;Release Candidate 5&#8221; (RC5), will be made publicly available Monday, September 22. It fixes the concerns raised by Mr. Atlas, increases anonymity, fixes bugs, and improves the user experience by implementing a new interface. After eight months of continuous improvement, the developers of Darkcoin are confident that the currency is finally ready to meet the scrutiny of coders world-wide. Duffield has announced that on <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1091700751"><span class="aQJ">September 29</span></span>, the source code of Darkcoin&#8217;s Darksend technology will be opened and published. This is the final piece of the overall system to be opened up. Darkcoin will then become the first fully open-source, decentralized, anonymous crypto-currency in the industry.</p>
<p>Future plans include the adoption of a new Instant Transactions technology which Duffield has described in his <a href="https://www.darkcoin.io/downloads/InstantTX.pdf">whitepaper</a>. This technology will allow Darkcoin to compete with other nearly instantaneous transaction systems such as credit cards. If successful, such an idea could revolutionize crypto-currencies by providing a decentralized payment system usable in retail stores and other face-to-face situations. The delay between sending and confirming transactions would be reduced from one hour (with currencies such as Bitcoin) to as little as twenty seconds. A future press release will describe the system in greater detail.</p>
<p>The Darkcoin client and more information can be obtained at their <a href="http://www.darkcoin.io">website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>About Darkcoin:</strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin works with an unprecedented level of transparency that most people are not used to dealing with. Every transaction that has ever happened is stored permanently in a ledger that is made public for the world to see, forever.</p>
<p>Darkcoin solves this problem by implementing an ahead-of-time CoinJoin implementation called Darksend. A user that wants to be anonymous can use the built-in technology to utilize the Masternode network to make their transaction nearly impossible to track.</p>
