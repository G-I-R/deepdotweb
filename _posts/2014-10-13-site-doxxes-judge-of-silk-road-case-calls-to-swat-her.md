<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Update 26.10.14</strong></span>: Added comment from freeross.org: We strongly condemn the outrageous threats to Judge Forrest</p>
<p>And the worst idea award for 2014 goes to the anonymous poster who created a page on (one of the) the Hidden Wiki(s), containing a full doxx (all personal details) of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York judge Katherine B. Forrest, who is the judge of the Silk Road case &#8211; Claiming &#8220;she is unfairly ruining Ross Ulbricht’s life and chance for a fair trail&#8221; (which might be true as far as we know) and offering to the public to steal her ID, send her gifts in the mail and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting">swat</a> her house among some other threats to release even further personal details about her family members.</p>
<p>Needless to say that this page <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>is <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">not</span> affiliated in any way with <a href="http://freeross.org/" target="_blank">freeross.org</a></strong></span><strong>. </strong><strong>As it was later noted in a <a href="http://freeross.org/we-condemn-the-outrageous-threats-to-judge-forrest/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on their site:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Ross and his family are horrified at the threats made to Judge Forrest. This is outrageous and reprehensible. We unequivocally, and in the strongest terms,  condemn this behavior.</p>
<p>Joshua Dratel, Ross’ lawyer, states the following:</p>
<p>I would prefer not to have to dignify these threats with a comment, but obviously, and as strongly as possible, we condemn them.  They do not in any way have anything to do with Ross Ulbricht or anyone associated with him, or reflect his views or those of anyone associated with him.</p></blockquote>
<p>To the person who created this page who might be reading this  &#8211; for the sake of every Tor user out there and for the sake of <a href="http://freeross.org/" target="_blank">freeross.org</a> &amp;  to prevent even more damage to Ulbricht&#8217;s case and family &#8211; please consider taking this page down. This will serve nothing but give Law Enforcement even reasons to go after Tor users in general.</p>

<p>Katherine Bolan Forrest is the judge who is unfairly ruining Ross Ulbricht&#8217;s life and chance for a fair trail. In case you are unaware of her, she was the Judge who <a class="external text" href="2014/07/09/judge-rejects-every-defense-argument-made-in-the-silk-road-trial/" rel="nofollow">&#8220;Rejected Every Defense Argument In The Silk Road Trial&#8221;</a> <sup><b>[</b> <b>Clearnet link!</b> <b>]</b></sup></p>
<p>Can Ulbricht really be accused of running a drug-selling conspiracy when he (<b>ALLEGEDLY</b>) merely ran a website that made the narcotics sales possible? And can he be charged with money laundering when bitcoin doesn’t necessarily meet the requisite definition of money?’ According to Forrest’s latest ruling, yes and yes. She rejected every argument made in the defense’s motion, starting with the idea that Ulbricht had merely provided an innocent platform for hosting the Silk Road’s illicit e-commerce, just as eBay might occasionally host illegal content without its knowledge.</p>
<p>Justice is not being served, Ross Ulbricht is a hard working honest man who is now a fall guy that the US government decided to choose because he had a large amount of bitcoins, a currency they are doing everything in their power to make illegal.</p>

<p>Without further ado, fuck this stupid bitch and I hope some drug cartel that lost a lot of money with the seizure of silk road will murder this lady and her entire family: {Link to full dox removed}<br/>

<p>I can also get information on all of this lady&#8217;s relatives and maybe some of her close friends, so expect more releases over doxbin and this wiki. For right now just steal her identity and send her gifts in the mail ;) Expect phone numbers and relatives SSNs and complete doxes in a future release.</p>
<p>Oh, and maybe someone should attempt a <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting" rel="nofollow">Swat</a>  just to put this bitch in her place. Just please don&#8217;t be an idiot and fall for that &#8220;Tor SWATing Service&#8221; scam going around. Oh and Katherine, don&#8217;t be surprised when you and all your relatives get woken up in the middle of the night by a swat team with assault rifles pointed in your face and helicopters shining search lights into your windows. Or when someone close to you opens up a letter in the mail one day and it happens to contain anthrax :)</p></blockquote>

<p>While its fine to argue if busting people like Ross is Ok or not or if he is innocent and is getting a fair trial, i &#8220;get the feeling&#8221; that posting such pages might cause much more damage and have no chance to in helping any real cause.</p>
