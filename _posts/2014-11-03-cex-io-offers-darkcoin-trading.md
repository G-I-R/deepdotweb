<p>The recent Moolah/Mintpal case has seen the altcoin community ramp up their search for secure and stable exchanges. Whilst some standard exchanges continue to function an all too often overlooked alternative is cex.io which acts not just as a cloud mining provider, as many associate it with, but also as an exchange. It includes a number of useful trading pairs, including dollars/euros, and of especial interest to the altcoin community is that is has firmly adopted Darkcoin. CEX.IO was an early believer in Darkcoin and, after extensive testing, is now challenging the traditional exchanges. This follows a general pattern of Darkcoin adoption in the cryptocurrency economy.</p>
<p>All this means cryptocurrency users are able to migrate their cloud mining operations to the same site as they conduct their trading, thereby making the entire process seamless. Both mining and trading are streamlined through a beautiful interface. For Darkcoin traders cex.io offers a strong alternative, opening up new opportunities such as trading Darkcoin to fiat alongside their Darkcoin mining operations. Debate concerning where to turn to next might finally be answered thanks for the faith cex.io has shown in Darkcoin.</p>
<p>CEX.IO is a London-based Bitcoin Crypto Exchange and the first cloud mining service. As an exchange, CEX.IO has a wide variety of trading pairs, including fiat money (USD and EUR), cryptocurrencies and a commodity (GHS or Bitcoin cloud mining power). CEX.IO works in conjunction with the largest Bitcoin mining pool â€” GHash.IO, and is trusted by over 300,000 users from all over the world.<br />
