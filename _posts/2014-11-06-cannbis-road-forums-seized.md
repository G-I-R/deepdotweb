<p>No doubt that the 6th of November 2014 will be remembered as one the darkest days in the Dark Net Markets history (the irony)Â  This is the 4th Darknet site to be taken down today &#8211; along with <a href="/2014/11/06/silk-road-2-seized/">Silk road 2</a> , <a href="/2014/11/06/multiple-market-takedown-hydra-marketplace-seized/">Hydra Market, Cloud 9 Market</a>, Cannabis road was a defunct market since it <a href="/2014/08/25/cannabis-road-hacked-100000-in-btc-gone/">was hacked</a> few months ago, but the forums remained active (at least the onion domain):</p>

<p>Its very hard to tell what is going on and how comes so many sites &#8211; that as far as we know, have no connection with each other are getting seized. We will keep following and updating as more info becomes available.</p>
