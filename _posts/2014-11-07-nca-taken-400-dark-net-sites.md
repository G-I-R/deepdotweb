<p>The most recent update about <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2014/11/06/major-darknet-related-bust-ireland/">operation Onymous</a> that resulted in the confirmed takedown of: <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2014/11/06/silk-road-2-seized/">Silk road 2</a> , <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2014/11/06/multiple-market-takedown-hydra-marketplace-seized/">Hydra Market, Cloud 9 Market</a>, and the OLD <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2014/11/06/cannbis-road-forums-seized/">cannabis road forums</a> and <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2014/11/07/old-cannbis-road-seized-fbi-raided-home-west-haven/">market</a>,  The National Crime Agency have posted a <a href="http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/news-listings/483-international-law-enforcement-deals-major-blow-to-dark-web-markets">statement</a> claiming that during the recent operation which is still ongoing &#8211; 400 DeepWeb sites were taken down and multiple people arrested, We could not confirm &#8211; manually or otherwise that 400 &#8220;known&#8221; Tor sites were taken down.  This is the statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coordinated activity by law enforcement in Europe and the US has targeted market places for illegal commodities on the dark web – the ‘hidden’ areas of the internet.</p>
<p>The National Crime Agency, working with police forces across the UK, arrested six people yesterday in strikes coordinated with international partners.  Those arrested include suspected administrators for the online drug market place Silk Road 2.0 and another drug market place, as well as significant vendors of illegal drugs through the dark web.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, partners from the European Cybercrime Centre – acting on intelligence developed by US counterparts &#8211; took out technical infrastructure which is key to the hosting of illegal market places on the dark web. In total over 400 dark web sites were taken down.</p>
<p>The six people arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs were a 20-year-old man from Liverpool city centre, a 19-year-old man from New Waltham, Lincolnshire; a 30-year-old man from Cleethorpes; a 29-year-old man from Aberdovey, Wales; a 58-year-old man from Aberdovey, Wales; and a 58-year-old woman from Aberdovey, Wales. All six were interviewed and have been bailed pending further enquiries.</p>
<p>A large amount of computer equipment was seized at all the addresses searched and will now be forensically examined.</p>
<p>The action yesterday by the NCA and partners across Europe and America is part of continuing operations to target the use of online market places to trade in illegal commodities such as class A drugs, firearms and false documents. Anyone who tries to access Silk Road 2.0 will now see a notice highlighting the site has been seized.<br/>

    Roy McComb, Deputy Director of the National Crime Agency, commented:</p>
<p>“Over the months since the original Silk Road was taken down, we have been working with partners in the US and Europe to locate technical infrastructure, key to the dark web and to investigate individuals suspected of significant involvement in illegal online market places. Those arrested by the NCA in this phase of the operation are suspected of setting up Silk Road 2.0, or of being significant vendors of illegal drugs.</p>
<p>“The operation is ongoing and more arrests can be expected as we continue to investigate those involved in setting up and profiting from these illegal market places. Criminals like to think that the dark web provides a safe, anonymous haven but in reality this is just like any other organised crime network. It may take time and effort to investigate and build a criminal case, but we are determined to identify and prosecute people caught dealing drugs and committing serious crime using the dark web.”</p></blockquote>
