Quoting the source article:</p>
<blockquote><p>A DUBLIN Gaelic footballer&#8217;s brother and a film technician have been accused of being involved in an online global drug-dealing operation using the Darknet.<br/>
    Neil Mannion and Richard O&#8217;Connor, both aged 33, appeared in Dublin District Court charged with drugs offences following a garda raid on a business premises in the south of the city.</p>
<p>Neil Mannion is a brother of Dublin senior and Kilmacud Crokes player Paul Mannion.</p>
<p>It is alleged Neil Mannion had his computer logged on to the Darknet when gardai carried out their search.</p>
<p>Both he and Mr O&#8217;Connor are each accused of possession of around €15,000 worth of ecstasy.</p>
<p>Gardai allege that an estimated €150,000 worth of suspected LSD was also seized, but this is not the subject of the charges.</p>
<p>Judge Patricia McNamara granted bail to Mr Mannion despite gardai objecting on grounds that they feared he might abscond or interfere with evidence.</p>
<p>There were no objections to Mr O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s bail and the cases were adjourned for the DPP to consider bringing further charges.</p>
<p>Mr Mannion, of Mount Drummond Avenue, Harold&#8217;s Cross, and Mr O&#8217;Connor, of Clonskeagh Road, Clonskeagh, are both charged with possession of ecstasy with intent to sell or supply at Bank House Business Centre, South Circular Road, on November 5 last.</p>

<p>Detective Garda Alan O&#8217;Connor said neither accused replied to the charges after caution.</p>
<p>Det Gda O&#8217;Connor said he was objecting to bail in Mr Mannion&#8217;s case because he believed he may abscond.</p>
<p>He said the case related to an international investigation into the sale and supply of controlled drugs on the Darknet &#8211; a &#8220;sub-level&#8221; of the internet.</p>
<p>A search was carried out in which a large quantity of drugs was seized.</p>
<p>It was alleged that Mr Mannion pointed out a holdall bag containing €15,000 worth of ecstasy.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the search took place, his computer was logged onto the marketplace on the Darknet, where it is alleged that he was plying his trade,&#8221; Det Gda O&#8217;Connor said. &#8220;It is alleged he implicated himself as a vendor on the Darknet whereby he sold controlled drugs to customers based at numerous locations all over the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
