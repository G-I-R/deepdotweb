<p>Just found out that the old hidden wiki domain kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion &#8211; Was also seized during <a href="tag/operation-onymous/">Operation Onymous</a> (or maybe shortly after)&#8221;</p>

<p>This is the old and original Hidden Wiki url that was changed many times and duplicated to many mirrors sites since it <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2014/03/14/hidden-wiki-hacked-wikitor-fills-gap/">was hacked</a> a few months ago and its private key was posted online to be used by anyone who wished to do so. So although its hard to believe that this was the actual real old hidden wiki site and hosting, its still interesting to learn that it was hosted along with some of the <a title="129 Of the Seized “.Onion” Domains Were at a Single Bulgarian Hosting" href="2014/11/08/129-seized-onion-domains-single-bulgarian-hosting/">other sites</a> on one of the <a title="NCA: “We have Taken down 400 Dark Net Sites”" href="2014/11/07/nca-taken-400-dark-net-sites/">seized servers</a> from the recent bust. Anyway, due to the notorious reputation of the Hidden Wiki for being a Hub for CP links,Scam and Phishing urls and due to the fact that there are many mirrors of the the site itself, its not hard to assume that no one will shed any tears about this takedown.</p>
<p>This is another part in the article series regarding Operation Onymous, a global crackdown on the Darknet Markets, During the operation there were:</p>
<ul>
<li>17 arrests</li>

<li>Hardware and digital media seized</li>
<li>Bitcoins worth approximately USD 1 000 000 and EUR 180 000 in cash, drugs, gold and silver seized</li>
</ul>
<p>Countries involved in the operation, codenamed ‘Onymous’, include Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the USA.</p>
