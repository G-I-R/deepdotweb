<p>A bit late since it took time to get the proper translation &#8211; <a href="http://www.lematin.ch/suisse/Le-FBI-fait-interpeller-un-Vaudois-chez-lui/story/24253596">Lematin.ch</a> reported a few days ago that the Swiss police executed an arrest warrant against a Swiss computer expert, at the request of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, thus taking the expert into custody.

<p>The Swiss computer expert is allegedly the administrator of a dark net site that sells weapons, illicit drugs, and false documents. The site, named &#8220;Black Market&#8221; (dgoega4kbhnp53o7.onion), which was a known scam site on the Tor network, was created by this alleged admin and offered mostly weapons for sale. Two weeks ago, the site was shut down during <a href="tag/operation-onymous/">Operation Onymous</a>.</p>
<p>The site had listings for AK47 assault rifles plated with 24 karat gold, a kilo of cocaine with a purity of 94%, an Australian identity card, fake 50 euro notes, and a driver&#8217;s license from California, United States of America.</p>
<p>The administrator&#8217;s arrest took place on the morning of November 6<sup>th</sup>, 2014, during Operation Onymous.</p>
<p><strong>Investigations Opened in the United States and Switzerland</strong></p>
<p>The arrested man confessed to authorities that he was indeed the site&#8217;s administrator, according to Yves Nicolet, a Swiss prosecutor. While interrogated, the man claimed that the dark net market was actually a scam operation; it collected money from buyers, but never delivered any products. This claim has been confirmed many times in the past. <a href="questions/question/black-market-guns-scam-or-real">This Question</a> is just one of several instances where the fraudulent nature of “Black Market” has been revealed in the various Dark Net market discussion areas. The prosecution, however, stated that the investigation is ongoing and it is not yet determined if the suspect was telling the truth about his connection to the dark net market.</p>
<p>In addition to the ongoing US investigation, Swiss authorities are pursuing prosecution against the suspect for proposing the sale of illegal products. &#8220;The fact that this happens on the internet does not diminish the seriousness of the criminal offense prosecuted ex officio,” says Yves Nicolet. “The suspect faces a custodial sentence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Authorities have not released the name of the “Black Market” administrator.</p>
