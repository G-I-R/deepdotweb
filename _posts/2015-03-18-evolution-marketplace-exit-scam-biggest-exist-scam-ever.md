<p>Updates will be added to this tag: <a href="#">#Evoscam</a></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Estimated</span> Loss: 40,000+ BTC  (Around 12$ Million)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Well, after posting yesterday about the <a href="#">12$ million</a>) but its pretty safe to assume its many millions of dollars in BTC.</p>
<p>The market is now down and Evolution Staff member NSWGreat <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2zeuxo/complaintwarning_evolution_admins_exit_scamming/">posted this</a> on Reddit:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hate to the bearer of bad news, but I&#8217;ve been suspicious the past few days with withdrawals not working and admins usually are more forth coming in explaining to me why they&#8217;re slow but they weren&#8217;t this time. Just kept giving me time-frames<br />
    I have admin access to see parts of the back end, the admins are preparing to exit scam with all the funds. Not a single withdrawal has gone through in almost a week. Automatic withdrawals has been disabled which is only doing on rare occasions</p>
<p>I am so sorry, but Verto and Kimble have fucked us all. I have over $20,000 in escrow myself from sales.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t fucking believe it, absolute scum. I am giving this warning to you all as soon as I possibly could of.</p>
<p>Confronted Kimble and Verto about it, they confirmed it and they&#8217;re doing it right now..</p>
<p>EDIT: Servers have gone down, including back up server for staff. I&#8217;m sorry for everyone&#8217;s loses, I&#8217;m gutted and speechless. I feel so betrayed.</p></blockquote>
<p>The forums are still up at this time (<strong>Edit</strong>: forums are down now).
