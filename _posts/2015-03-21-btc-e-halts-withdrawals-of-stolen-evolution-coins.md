<p>Another <a href="#">#Evoscam</a> development &#8211; &#8220;No one can withdraw their coins on BTC-e, some of the evolution coins have made it to the exchange. Some people were receiving PMs offering coins in exchange for helping to withdraw the stolen coins, looks like some sort of tumbling attempt. paulgr (in the image above) is a mod on the trollbox, explaining the situation after speaking to the devs. paulgr: &#8220;The support team is in contact with the other main exchanges and all are working together to ensure we don&#8217;t get dumped on&#8221; tl;dr: Evo coins are making their way to exchanges.&#8221;</p>
