<p><em>Recapping the week’s biggest Bitcoins stories from around the web. </em></p>
<p><strong>Will UK Bitcoin regulation get clearing banks on-board?</strong></p>
<p>Probably the most notable piece of positive bitcoin news, The UK government’s commitment to injecting $ 14.6 million into research on digital currencies. The announcement was made by the UK treasury right about the same time as the annual budget speech by Chancellor of Exchequer.</p>
<p>The statement emphasised regulation of digital currency exchanges to bring much needed transparency and customer protection in the industry. Measures such as anti-money laundering legislation were highlighted in a 28 page <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/414040/digital_currencies_response_to_call_for_information_final_changes.pdf">report</a> (pdf) titled ‘<em>Digital currencies: response to the call for information</em> ‘The document highlights risks and opportunities in payment.</p>
<p><em>“The government considers that digital currencies represent an interesting development in payments technology … the potential advantages are clearest for purposes such as micro-payments and cross-border transactions.”</em></p>
<p>This follows a report in February by the bank of England on the same. The UK Government is level headed in its approach, calling for input from stakeholders. Fintech start-ups in the UK expressed ambivalence. Elliptic, a Bitcoin vault service in London hailed government action plans as encouraging. Azteco founder, Akin Fernandez was less thrilled by what he termed as ‘artificial restrictions’.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin price spikes down on hacker news</strong></p>
<p>The price of bitcoin took a dive down to a low of $ 343.9 after a 43% stable rally since February 14. Some traders had expected a retest of lower prices at these price levels, touting the short rally as weak and not enough to break the long term bear trend. Most traders agreed the decline was catalysed by news of $12 million worth of bitcoin stolen.</p>
<p><strong>Hackers steal 150 BTC from Coinapult</strong></p>
<p>43,000 worth of bitcoins were lost in an unauthorized withdrawal from Coinapult’s hot wallet attack. Coinapult confirmed this is via an investigative report dated March 17. Details of the compromised address: 12LszeXACdj9bdETzv8BkXyWeabZ1151aA and transaction ID were highlighted in the report; this allowed the coins to be traced to their destination address.</p>
<p>Coinapult CFO Justin Blicoe while speaking to Coin Desk, emphasized customer funds were not affected. The results of their investigations can be accessed on this report <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_xxKLUVvEcen6XI7DsUzLtv2_C8oQ8JzAwlsNOMnapg/pub">here</a></p>
<p><strong>BTC-e exchange withdrawals halted</strong></p>
<p>In a strange turn of events, BTC – e exchange warned customers about <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2015/03/21/btc-e-halts-withdrawals-of-stolen-evolution-coins/" target="_blank">suspicious withdrawal requests</a>. According to support, an attempt to withdraw bitcoins stolen from Evolution was flagged.</p>
<p>“<em>. . . it seems some of the evo coins have made it into the system. DON’T accept any coins to help withdraw.</em>”</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s fungibility has been at the centre of debate; incidences of mixing stolen coins and ‘normal’ coins raises legal challenges. On the one hand, it is no different from cash but, at the same time, exchanges are under strict scrutiny and have to monitor cases of money laundering.</p>
<p><strong>8th largest internet company now accepts Bitcoin</strong></p>
<p>Japanese e commerce giant, Rakuten Inc., announced it will now allow customers to use bitcoin for purchases online via Bitnet. This follows a hint in February by Rakuten CEO Hiroshi Mikitani, that they would accept bitcoins at some point in future. Bitcoin payment option is limited to US customers at the moment, however, Rakuten expects to follow suit in Austria and Germany later in the 2nd quarter.</p>
<p>Yaz Iida, President of Rakuten USA said of Bitcoin <em>“[Bitcoin] has the potential to benefit society by enhancing the security, privacy and convenience of financial transactions.”</em></p>
<p>Rakuten Inc. is ranked as the 8th largest internet company in the world – valued at $36 billion. It adds to the growing list of large internet companies embracing bitcoin for online payments.</p>
<p><strong>ChangeTip integrates Bitcoin tips for Twitch.tv</strong></p>
<p>Twitch, an online gaming streaming service that accepts bitcoin payments, now allows users to tip each other in bitcoin. Changetip – an online bitcoin tipping services, officially integrated a tip bot Twitch.tv. Changetip followed the announcement with a donation of $10,000 worth in bitcoins to prominent Twitch users; an incentive to jumpstart bitcoin tipping. Twitch.tv currently accounts for 2% of America’s online video traffic, and is accessed by millions of users each month. The company was valued at $1 billion when Google acquired it in July, 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Credit Suisse recommends Bitcoin for traditional banking systems</strong></p>
<p>Finally, Credit Suisse published an article titled “<a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/ch/en/news-and-expertise/news/banking.article.html/article/pwp/news-and-expertise/2015/03/en/bitcoins-money-without-physical-form.html"><em>Bitcoins – Money Without Physical Form</em></a>.” The company took a lukewarm approach towards Bitcoin while recommending its combination with traditional banking services. The paper is a sober look at bitcoins potential and shortcomings as a currency and a security network. Credit Suisse is a venerable multinational financial institution; such articles are a good indicator of how banks are warming up to Bitcoin.</p>
