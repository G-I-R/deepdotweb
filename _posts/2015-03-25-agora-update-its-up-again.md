<p><strong>Update, Buyers url is up BUT VERY SLOW &#8211; Possibly due to <a href="/2015/03/25/agora-update-its-up-again/">DDOS Attack</a> on Hidden Services:</strong></p>

<p>According to multiple reports in the last couple of hours &#8211; Agora&#8217;s vendor only link is reported as up and running, displaying the following message: <em> &#8220;The market is back to normal operation, specifically all the funds are intact and ready for usage/withdrawals. Sorry for the downtimes and inconvenience.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The buyers url still brings up a broken login screen, but seems that the panic is about to be over, and the market will soon be functional again:</p>

<p><strong>Be patient &#8211; the market will be VERY slow, due to the tremendous load. </strong></p>
