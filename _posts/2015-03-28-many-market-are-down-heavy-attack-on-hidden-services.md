<p>PSA: YES, we know, just today we received around 1000 mails and comments regarding this issue and <strong>yes</strong> &#8211; many markets are down, there is some sort of attack going on, hitting hidden services (.onion sites), there is nothing you can do, be patient,Â  Tor network developers are working on fixing this issues at Top priority.</p>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> an Agora / Middle Earth / Nucleus or whatever other market that is down issue, this is a Tor network issue (although there is always the chance of some markets taking advantage of the situation, there are no such cases there we made aware of)</p>
<p>Just try other markets at this time.</p>
