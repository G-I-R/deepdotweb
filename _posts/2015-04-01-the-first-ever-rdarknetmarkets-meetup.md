<p>Hello everyone!!! we&#8217;re so excited to present the first ever <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets">/r/DarkNetMarkets</a> meetup! We&#8217;ll be offering free drugs, free booze, and free food. All funded by your favorite moderators and vendors. This will take place June the 9th-11th in Lisbon, Portugal. You are probably asking yourself why Portugal? Drugs are NOT illegal in Portugal!! How awesome is that? so there is nothing illegal about having this meeting!</p>
<p>Due to obvious OPSEC issues a few rules will be put in place:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. <strong>Nobody</strong> is allowed to say who they are at the event</li>
<li>2. Masks must be worn at all times, get creative!</li>
<li>3. No outside substances. All products provided have been tested for legitimacy. We want to avoid the need of calling 911</li>
<li>4. To request an invite, your Reddit account needs to be <strong>&gt;60 days old.</strong> This is to prevent possible LE showing up.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your reddit account meets the criteria go ahead &amp; visit the site below to register &amp; learn more about the event!</p>
