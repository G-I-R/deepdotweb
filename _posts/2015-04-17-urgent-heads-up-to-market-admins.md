<blockquote><p>MS15-034 / CVE-2015-1635</p>
<p>If you are running IIS, either stop (best practice) or patch YESTERDAY.</p>
<p>We already have a listing for fully working RCE exploit with quite convincing technical details to back the vendor&#8217;s claims.<br/>
<strong>We also know of at least 2 markets running IIS.</strong></p>
<p>All the best,<br/>
    TheRealDeal Market</p></blockquote>
<p>The listing of the exploit on TheRealDeal:</p>
