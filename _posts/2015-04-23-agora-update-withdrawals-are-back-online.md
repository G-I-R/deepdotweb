<p>The most recent update from Agora admins:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="market-wide-message">Withdrawals are back online. Since many online services may not accept payments that are coming in too late, we have cancelled such delayed requests, and in that case you might need to schedule the withdrawal again on the wallet page (it should be back in your balance).</span></p></blockquote>

<p>We were able to verify that deposit and <span class="market-wide-message">Withdrawals </span>worked fine. but will keep following for further developments.</p>
