<p>UPDATE:Â  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/">/r/darknetmarkets</a> is back from the dead! (but you are still invited to subscribe for <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/deepdotweb">/r/deepdotweb</a>)</p>
<p>I have no idea what happened but the main source for Dark net markets discussion was set to private, and Astrid account deleted (the main mod account)</p>
