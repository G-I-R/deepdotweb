<p><em>Guest Post</em> &#8211; The spotlight looming over legal highs doesn’t seem to be going away. The world has become obsessed with the latest in the legal highs world and the on-going battle to get these substances banned.</p>
<p>If you don’t already know, confiscated drugs are tested by government experts and if they are believed to be dangerous, the substances are banned individually. Some manufacturers tweak ingredients to make a new drug with similar effects, but isn’t illegal. On Friday April 10<sup>th</sup> the government announced a temporary banning order on ethylphenidate and related products.</p>
<p>The temporary Class Drug Order (TCDO) makes the following compounds illegal to supply, import or export:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3,4-Dichloromethylphenidate (3,4-DCMP)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ethylphenidate</strong></li>
<li><strong>Isopropylphenidate (IPP or IPPD)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Methylnaphthidate (HDMP-28)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Propylphenidate </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve all seen the headlines:</p>
<p><strong>“MPs Putting Lives at Risk over Legal Highs”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Expert warns: ‘Legal highs’ are more dangerous than illegal drugs”</strong></p>
<p>There’s a large market out there for people seeking legal highs and as a result, online headshops are making strong profits selling these substances. They can vouch that customer numbers are definitely not going down; in fact they appear to be on the up.</p>
<p>With all this negative press and health warnings, the question people may be asking is <strong>who is still buying this stuff and where from? </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.iceheadshop.co.uk/">ICE Headshop</a> is one of the largest online headshops in the UK, selling a wide range of products to thousands of customers every single month. They were kind enough to share their sales data so we can get a deeper insight into their customer base.</p>

<p>Many assume it’s the naive and rebellious teenagers that are buying legal highs online. However, it would seem this is not necessarily the case. In fact the 25-34 year old age bracket seems to enjoy getting high that bit more. This will probably come as a surprise to many, but users aged 45+ make up over 20% of total website traffic.</p>

<p>As you can see, this is a male dominated market. Other data also shows that up to 10% of customers are avid lovers of movies, TV and technology, which is unsurprising with the nature of some of the products.</p>
