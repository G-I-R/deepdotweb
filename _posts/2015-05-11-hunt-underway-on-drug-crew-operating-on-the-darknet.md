<blockquote><p>I think we missed this article because it is behind a soft pay wall:</p>

<hr/>
<p>Very short summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Postal distribution center and UPS in the area intercepted several packages filled with drugs (probably due to bad stealth).</li>
<li>Police managed to narrow down the area.</li>
<li>Forensic research underway</li>
<li>Already linked to the Darknet. Mentions Agora, SR and BTC</li>
<li>They seem to know who the vendor is and in which area he is located</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p>I am at work so I have no time for a translation. Just wanted to make sure nobody missed this.</p></blockquote>
<p>So LE are trying to warn dutch vendors to improve their OPSEC?Â  this press release seems a bit unusual as no busts were made and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
