<p>Following our previous post &#8220;<a title="Permalink to AlphaBay Market Launched a Fully-Automated Stolen Credit Card Shop" href="/2015/05/20/alphabay-dark-net-market-launched-a-fully-automated-credit-card-shop/" rel="bookmark">AlphaBay Market Launched a Fully-Automated Stolen Credit Card Shop</a>&#8221; and the statement by <a href="#">AlphaBay</a>Â  admin saying that they are planning to launch a similar automatic shop for hacked and stolen accounts:</p>
<blockquote><p>like facebook, gmail, bank logins, whatever you imagine!</p></blockquote>
<p>We can confirm that the accounts autoshop is now live, as the their site say:</p>
<blockquote><p>The autoshop now supports accounts, so you can buy Paypal / RDP / social media and other accounts from the vendors in the autoshop</p></blockquote>
