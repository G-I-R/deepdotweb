<p>Not long we reported about a new market selling <a href="https://gir.pub/deepdotweb/2015/04/08/therealdeal-dark-net-market-for-code-0days-exploits/">Zero day exploits</a>, and it seems that exploits are becoming more common than ever on the deepweb. Recently a new site was launched and started offering free creation of <a href="http://www.google.co.il/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRansomware&amp;ei=yqtlVazNCKLm7gbYtYDAAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFmLFQPv1m8Vvhc2iGmkBPO5Jg5TQ&amp;sig2=OyC1Wplmbq-G3XcGJvGy6g&amp;bvm=bv.93990622,d.d24">ransomware</a> &#8211; in exchange for 30% of the BTC profits made from ransoms. According to the site itself (toxicola7qwv37qj.onion):</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>What is Tox?</strong></p>
<p>We developed a virus which, once opened in a Windows OS, encrypts all the files.<br/>
    Once this process is completed, it displays a message asking to pay a ransom to a bitcoin address to unlock the files.</p>
<p><strong>How do I make money with Tox?</strong></p>
<p>You can subscribe (no mail or other shit needed) and create your virus. You will have to decide the ransom to unlock the files.<br/>
    Once you have downloaded your virus, you have to infect people (yes, you can spam the same virus to more people). How? That&#8217;s your part. The most common practice to spam it as a mail attachment. If you decide to follow this method be sure to zip the file to prevent antivirus and antispam detection.<br/>
    The most important part: <b>the bitcoin</b> paid by the victim <b>will be credited to your account</b>. We will just keep a 30% fee of the income, so if you specify a 100$ ransom, you will get 70$ and we&#8217;ll get 30$, isn&#8217;t this fair?</p>
<p><strong>F.A.Q.</strong><br/>
<strong>Are you serious?</strong><br/>
    Yes, why not? This is the best way for us to infect a lot of people and make a lot of money.<br/>
<strong>Am I safe?</strong><br/>
    Sure, as long as you use tor and don&#8217;t use personally identifiable information: we don&#8217;t need to know you, and you don&#8217;t need to know us. The only thing we&#8217;ll ask you is the bitcoin address to withdraw your part.<br/>
<strong>Are you going to steal my profit?</strong><br/>
    Nope, why should we? The best way for us to make money is having you helping us.<br/>
<strong>Then why aren&#8217;t you spreading the virus yourself?</strong><br/>
    We are! But with you, we&#8217;re going to have a bigger income.<br/>
<strong>Why is the file a .scr?</strong><br/>
    Because in this way people will not suspect anything (who knows what is a .scr?). If you wish, you can change it to .exe it&#8217;ll work the same.<br/>
<strong>How does the virus look?</strong><br/>
    Sexy. The virus has a .src extension (same as .exe files) and it has the icon of a word document, so the victim wont be suspecting anything.<br/>
<strong>Will you actually decrypt the files once the ransom is paid?</strong><br/>
    Yes, we will. We want people to trust us, so that more people will pay the ransom.<br/>
<strong>How dow I withdraw the money?</strong><br/>
    In the virus section you can monitor the status of all your viruses. When you have bitcoins to withdraw, just enter your address and press the Withdraw button</p></blockquote>
<p>We did not take the ransomware to a test drive, but a blog post from <a href="https://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/meet-tox-ransomware-for-the-rest-of-us">mcafee.com</a> shows exactly how it works. It was reported by <a href="http://securityzap.com/tox-ransomware-creator/">other blogs</a> that several anti virus softwares are able to detect the ransomware.</p>
