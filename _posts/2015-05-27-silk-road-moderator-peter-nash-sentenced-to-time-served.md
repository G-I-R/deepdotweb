<p>Great news regarding Peter Nash one of the 3 <a href="https://gir.pub/deepdotweb/2013/12/21/silk-road-adminsmods-ssbd-libertas-inigo-arrested/">arrested moderators</a> of Silk road &#8211; according to to <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/silk-road-member-peter-nash-avoids-further-us-prison-time-20150526-ghaflb.html">smh.com.au</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An Australian man who moderated the discussion forums on the underground drug website Silk Road was sentenced to time served on Tuesday after already being in custody for 17 months.</p>
<p>Peter Nash, 42, dropped his head into his hands as US District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan announced the sentence, which came after he provided prosecutors information about his conduct and pleaded guilty.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very gratifying that Peter can return home and be reunited with his fiancée and his family,&#8221; Andrew Frisch, his lawyer, said outside of court.</p>
<p>The proceedings came just three days before a US federal judge is set to sentence Ross Ulbricht, the creator of Silk Road who authorities say operated the website under the alias Dread Pirate Roberts. He faces up to life in prison.</p></blockquote>
