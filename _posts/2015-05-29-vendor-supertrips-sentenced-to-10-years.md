<p>A Dutch man described by the U.S. as the biggest drug dealer on Silk Road was ordered to serve 10 years in prison a day before the convicted mastermind of the illegal online marketplace is set to learn his fate.</p>
<p><strong>Cornelis Jan Slomp</strong>, 23, a software developer who used the moniker “<a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/?s=SuperTrips">SuperTrips</a>” and sold cocaine, Ecstasy and LSD, was sentenced Thursday in Chicago after pleading guilty to drug trafficking. Prosecutors are seeking more than 20 years in prison for Ross William Ulbricht, found guilty by a jury of running Silk Road while using the online name “Dread Pirate Roberts,” when he appears before a Manhattan judge Friday.</p>
<p>Lawyers for both the government and Slomp extolled his cooperation with a U.S. probe of the illicit emporium. Prosecutors asked for a 15-year sentence while defense attorney Paul Petruzzi sought a term of just under six years. Federal guidelines called for a prison term of as long as 40 years.</p>
<p>Outside court, Petruzzi called his client’s punishment “a damn good result, if you ask me.”</p>
<p>Silk Road was described by federal prosecutors in New York as a “sprawling black-market bazaar” used to anonymously sell illicit goods and launder money. The Silk Road website was shut in 2013.</p>
