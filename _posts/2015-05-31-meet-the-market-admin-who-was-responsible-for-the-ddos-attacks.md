<p>Without getting into too much details &#8211; a market was responsible to at least some if not most of the DDosing of the past 2 weeks, luckily the ddoser account got hacked by another market admin who was extorted by him (<a href="#">TRD</a>), and all communication documented &#8211; its pretty much self explanatory, added some comments:</p>
<p><em><strong>* Need to point out that he wasn&#8217;t responsible for the initial ddosing &#8211; but onlty after he was contacted by the ddoser</strong></em></p>
<p>At first,Â  he was ddosed himself and was asked for a ransom to stop the attack:<br />
