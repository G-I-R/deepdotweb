<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="/2015/06/08/new-onion-address-deepdot35wvmeyd5-onion/">New onion URL</a></p>
<p>You asked and we listened. So good news to our readers out there &#8211;  from now on you can browse <strong>DeepDotWeb</strong> 100% anonymously using our new Onion gateway:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>http://rtz6kznga4anujwu.onion</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Site is <strong>fully functional</strong> on the onion version <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">with disabled scripts</span>  </strong>(Only 3 negligible features won&#8217;t work &#8211; leaving stars rating when writing market reviews, the homepage slider and the top news scroller won&#8217;t show)</li>
<li>NO CLOUDFLARE</li>
<li>100% anonymous browsing and participation.</li>
<li>Although we could never confirm that these ever happened here, but anyway &#8211; No risk of malicious exit nodes or any other type of MiTM attacks</li>
<li>In the upcoming week or two, new HTTPS &amp; HSTS should be implemented on the clearnet version. The delay is due to some technical difficulties we are working on.</li>
<li>Hoping that this won&#8217;t be abused too much so we will be able to keep this gateway up and running.</li>
<li>This is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only</strong></span> real URL:  <strong>http://rtz6kznga4anujwu.onion</strong></li>
</ul>
