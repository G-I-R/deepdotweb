<p>Not a huge surprise or &#8220;breaking news&#8221;, but after few weeks of speculations, it seems that <a href="/2015/05/25/did-the-2-largest-dark-net-market-blackbank-exit-scammed/">Blackbank&#8217;s exit scam</a> is now confirmed, as the Funds were finally drained out of official (known) wallet addresses as we can see in wallet explorer:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/BlackBankMarket/addresses">Known Wallet addresses related to BlackBankMarket via Walletexplorer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/BlackBankMarket/addresses">BlackBank &#8220;Known&#8221; Wallet</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For everyone who lost money &#8211; sorry for your loss.  The stolen amount was an unknown amount of over <strong>606BTC</strong> (The sum contained in the KNOWN related wallets listed above, we can assume that there was more in other wallets &#8211; not linked to Blackbank via walletexplorer)</p>
<p><strong>On a more positive note</strong>, check the sidebar of this site &#8211; there are more than enough <a href="/2013/10/28/updated-llist-of-hidden-marketplaces-tor-i2p/">alternative markets</a>.</p>
