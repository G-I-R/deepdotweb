<p>It&#8217;s time to present you a guide outlining how to purchase things from Outlaw Market. Make extra sure that you have entirely read this whole tutorial before diving in – it&#8217;s very, very important you fully comprehend each and every step. The following guide is to assist you to purchase, not to sell items. Vending is a wholly other animal which requires much heavier time, effort, and consideration.</p>
<p>The Listing for Outlaw Market as well as its official onion link are placed <a href="#">here</a></p>
<p><strong>Part 1 – Preparing</strong></p>
<p><strong>USE A VPN SERVICE</strong>. You can find one <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/vpn-comparison-chart/">here</a> to best suit you, we review the best VPN Services for privacy on the market<a href="http://silkroaddrugs.org/bestproxy">.</a> Every time you use your computer your IP address is shown which reveals your actual physical address which means you can be traced very easily. A VPN must be used along with Tor (Tor is the free browser explained below) to make your online activity anonymous. When using a <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/vpn-comparison-chart/">VPN Service</a> it will hide your identity and location while also encrypting all of you internet traffic from everyone including your internet service provider.<a href="http://silkroaddrugs.org/bestproxy"> </a>This technology will also protect you from identity theft and hacking when using free wifi because everything is encrypted. Any time you are searching for music, movies to download, pirated content, drugs or anything illegal then you should be using a VPN to fly under the radar. The law is trying to monitor everything we do now so don’t make it easy for them, don’t end up like the original mastermind of Silk Road and get busted. This is a must have in your anonymous arsenal.</p>

<p>Your first-ever step in buying something via any marketplace whatsoever, is properly setting-up your digital environment. Following below is a bare standard minimum in order to stay safe when buying personal items. After you are done, make sure you glance at the <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/security-tutorials">Security Tutorials section</a> for several additional tips in security.</p>
<p><strong>Tor Browser Bundle</strong></p>
<p>
<p>To visit the darkweb, you will need to visit <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html">https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html</a> and download what is known as the Tor Browser Bundle, for your current OS. There are plenty of detailed instructions for installing it on its download webpage, for OS X, Windows, even Debian, too.</p>
<p><strong>PGP</strong></p>
<p>
<p>PGP is an especially useful method of encrypting/decrypting sensitive messages. It&#8217;s not very good of an idea to tell a vendor, your home address without first encrypting it, because should the hidden service get seized, LE will have clearly-cut evidence of the crime you have committed. One thought to bear in mind is that <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/security-tutorials/word-warning-versions-pgp-created-equally">not all versions of GPG are created equally</a>, so avoid using GPG methods such as iGolder or those utilizing the BouncyCastle libraries.</p>
<p>This site has long had essential, fundamental guides covering GPG for each and every mainstream OS, <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2015/02/17/basic-guide-pgp-linux">Linux</a>, <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2015/02/20/pgp-tutorial-os-x">OS X</a>, and then <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2015/02/21/pgp-tutorial-for-windows-kleopatra-gpg4win">Windows</a>. Linux is the best choice, obviously; however, you will be fine ordering personal goods on either OS X and Windows.</p>
<p>With Outlaw Market&#8217;s mandatory PGP policy and its obviously better-secure PGP-login system which you should definitely utilize, this habit will become not only inevitable but also essential.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong></p>
<p>
<p>You can&#8217;t really buy anything on the darkweb, without first owning bitcoin, can we? You&#8217;ll need to buy Bitcoin(s), something you can do with <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/buy-bitcoins-with-paypal-credit-cards">paypal or credit cards</a>, find a local <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-atm-map">Bitcoin ATM machine</a>, or order with <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/">fiat cash</a>. Whichever way you buy Bitcoin is completely up to your own preference. Regardless, <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/?ch=4v6y">LocalBitcoin</a> is one of the most widely-popular options for a reason: it can be done anonymously. There&#8217;ve also been reports of Coinbase taking ban action against accounts involved in Darkweb Market deposits, so avoid that if you&#8217;re able. Secondly, don&#8217;t stay connected Tor while purchasing Bitcoin(s), because it is totally legal and buying through Tor often becomes a cumbersome ordeal.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet</strong></p>
<p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve purchased some Bitcoins, you need to store them somewhere. A particularly great choice is the open-source Electrum Wallet. This is also cross-platform and has a downloadable version for Android phones. Go ahead, download it <a href="https://electrum.org/download.html">here</a>. Using the Electrum Wallet is quite easily accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2 – Some beginning tips</strong></p>
<p>Some beginning tips for new users are laid out, here – some are from personal experiences and others from stories across the web:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remember to use your biological name because nothing draws more attention than a fake name; however, use a drop system: this is where you employ a chain of houses through where the item travels after having been shipped or a P.O. Box which you can get for almost no money and even a faux name (be sure to have the forged documents to back your case up).</li>
<li>If you do end up deciding to use a faux name, ensure you&#8217;ve got real-looking document forgeries to back that up, should confrontation occur. Fake identification, plus utility-bill scans are mostly sufficient to open up a P.O. box under said faux name.</li>
<li>Be patient when you can, during the majority of the time. Outlaw Market isn&#8217;t Amazon &#8211; things do often have totally unexpected delays; vendors usually mark ordered items as shipped immediately upon receiving the notification, even though they only ship the day after then. Weather and holidays can significantly delay otherwise-proper shipping/delivery time. The only time you should rebutt an order&#8217;s shipment after not arriving, is once you have waited, in the least, 14 days after the failed expected delivery, or around when Auto-finalize is almost activated.</li>
<li>Encrypt all you can, including messages you send. It&#8217;s worth this small extra effort to avoid pennitentiary time.</li>
<li>Should there be any negative experience with a vendor, try to message them, prior to giving a bad review. Chances are that the vendor will go to extreme lengths to make sure you get what you need, and have it all sorted sufficiently. Be as kind and polite as you can; it will move you farther in the process of getting stuff done.</li>
<li>No one should ever know you make purchases on DNMs. This includes not telling your friends or even close family.</li>
<li>Remember to launder your coins with the built-in mixer on Outlaw Market. More on that, later.</li>
<li>Anything in the market that looks too great to be true, is, in all probability, a scam.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Part 3 – What is Outlaw Market?</strong></p>
<p>Outlaw Market is by far, not even close to the newest DNM on the block, dating back to the era prior to Silk Road 1&#8217;s seizure/shut-down, having been known originally as Drugs and Bets – a market initially geared towards and targeting the German user-base. A few of the [former] Outlaw-Market administrators did retire from their positions, then establishing the now-defunct Area51 Market, a later exit-scam culprit. Outlaw Market generally focuses on drug-related items, with only a minor focus on digital items and even weapons</p>
<p><strong><u>Pros</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Forced GPG on everyone, for an improved system of security.</li>
<li>Straightforward Search-filter system.</li>
<li>Multisig</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Cons</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As a vendor, you pay a subscription fee, as opposed to an application fee (this may be seen as a <em>Pro</em> by some, nevertheless).</li>
<li>The UI</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Getting Support:</strong></p>
<p>To get the administrator&#8217;s assistance, private-message them, by clicking the “Messages” link on the topbar of the website, on any page.</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/toolbar1.png">

<p>The &#8216;Admin&#8217; user is already auto-filled, as seen below:</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/contactadmin21.png">

<p>Please note that never ever, will a staff-member request the details of your buyer-or-otherwise account.</p>
<p><strong>Part 4 – Creating an account</strong></p>
<p>By now, it is hopeful that you&#8217;ve setup the digital tools of the trade, and&#8217;ve read through our elementary security tips. To purchase from a vendor on Outlaw Market, you must have an account. In order to register at Outlaw Market, use this <a href="http://outfor6jwcztwbpd.onion/indxx1.php">link</a></p>
<p>After you have clicked that referral, you&#8217;ll be landed onto the page in the image underneath:</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/OUTLAW_Market_htm_201509131129331.png">

<p>Once you register, you&#8217;ll be required to setup your public GPG key. This will allow you to decrypt your one-time pass-key (OTP) each time you login: <a href="http://s8.postimg.org/yujnzhdjp/pgp.png">
http://s8.postimg.org/yujnzhdjp/pgp.png</a>]
<p>To login-to Outlaw with GPG one-time-passwords, use this button at the main log-in screen:</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/pgp31.png">

<p>and you be brought to screen, afterwards:</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/pgp21.png">

<p>Decrypt the PGP-encrypted message in the first box, and paste the resulting One-Time Pass-key (OTP) into the second box below the one including the original message.</p>
<p>This is quite like using Two-factor authentication, except there&#8217;s no permanent account passphrase. This also makes it ideal, especially for those who tend to illogically use the same password across several hidden services or even clearnet sites, etc.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to start filling out the required info in the registration form. In the &#8216;Username&#8217; field, choose something, anything really, which you have not used anywhere, elsewhere. This is, too, applicable to the choice of your password and then your PIN, which are both optimally designed to protect your account and its included coins. Once you&#8217;ve input all of the required info, then submitted, jot down your password/PIN combination in a particularly safe place. Now, of course, if you haven&#8217;t noticed already, you will be able to visit the marketplace.</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/home1.png">

<p><strong>Part 6 – Choosing what to buy</strong></p>
<p>Now that your buyng -account is properly set-up at last, shopping can take place once and for all.</p>
<p><strong>Searching</strong></p>
<p>Searching on Outlaw Market is even past more straightforward than other markekts, especially with regards to entirely filtering out FE-enabled listings (with the un-tick of the checkbox), as well as only displaying results which happen to be domestically-shipped (that is, from within one&#8217;s own country; this does not have to pass the ever-checking Customs patrol-agents). This filter mechanism is seen below.</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/image11.png">

<p><strong>FE vs No-FE</strong></p>
<p>FE (finalize-early) is a procedure by which the vendor can retrieve the payment from any sale without waiting for the escrow, which is designed to make sure you do receive your product, to release funds. It&#8217;s quite discouraged in this industry, due to the obvious risks involved. Will you encounter a scam on an FE listing, your funds are undoubtedly not recoverable.</p>
<p><strong>Buying from within your own country</strong></p>
<p>This is called buying domestically, as is explained earlier, during the Searching section. You will want to choose this as often as you are reasonably able, unless you are otherwise purchasing a digital good. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that domestic shipping can be useful for even digital goods, with international agreements, i.e., the revision of Wassenaar in this year of 2015 – even digitally exporting/importing can wreak havoc on you, should you be caught with something less-than-lawful.</p>
<p><strong>Judging the Vendor</strong></p>
<p>On Outlaw Market, you cannot click directly onto a vendor&#8217;s name, bringing you to their profile, from the search results, themselves; you must click on an individual for-sale item and then choose the vendor&#8217;s name towards the top, below the item&#8217;s name, as depicted clearly beneath:</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/vend01.png">

<p>By clicking the green text-hyperlink as is shown in the screenshot above, labeled with our vendor&#8217;s name, you are brought to this page in particular (some of the page&#8217;s components are cropped/removed due to relative insignificance in this point being made):</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/vendprof1.png">

<p>Each vendor has his or her GPG key listed as well as the feedback they have received, thus far. Keep note, nonetheless, that a vendor who has positive reviews is not necessarily foolproof or incapable of exit-scamming.</p>
<p>Another great way to get a general feel of a vendor&#8217;s reliability is to read reviews of them on the <a href="#">Grams</a>, after you search for a listing or vendor&#8217;s name. This also compiles all that vendor&#8217;s listings across markets.</p>
<p><strong>Part 7 – Making your order</strong></p>
<p>After you have finally discovered a nicely-looking listing from a vendor of reputation, and are finally ready to start ordering, let&#8217;s cover that right now!</p>
<p><strong>Laundering your coins:</strong></p>
<p>Lucky for you Outlaw-Market users, you do not at all need an external blender such as <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2014/06/22/introducing-grams-helix-bitcoins-cleaner">Grams&#8217;s Helix</a> (you can either register for a small fee or you can use the Lite version; this service does not only blend your coins – it gives you new coins), <a href="http://bitmixer2whesjgj.onion/">BitMixer</a>, or alternatively, but less optimally, either (due to fees and the fact it is a clearnet website) <a href="http://app.bitlaundry.com/">BitLaundry</a> or <a href="https://sharedcoin.com/">SharedCoin</a> (this requires a Blockchain wallet: you are better off with a service that does not require a cloud wallet, in general, for obvious security/privacy concerns and to evade LE investigations).</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/blend11.png">

<p>Once you click that button on the login/index screen, you will be brought to this page:</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/OUTLAW_mixing_service_htm_201509131144111.png">

<p>Choosing to blend your coins is really up to your own preference, but I highly recommend it. Should you decide to take that extra step, choosing between either Outlaw-Market&#8217;s built-in feature or an external service is also up to you. Whatever you do, it is probably best to try to avoid <a href="http://foggeddriztrcar2.onion/">BTC-Fog</a> (there have been several selective scam reports).</p>
<p><strong>Adding funds to your wallet:</strong></p>
<p>To quickly check your balance, look no further than the side of the website:</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/balanceshow1.png">

<p>To add funds, click the &#8216;Account&#8217; link on the top-bar at the top of the site, and you will be brought to this page:</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/wallet12.png">

<p>You will need to generate an on-site wallet for your account, by inserting your personal bitcoin wallet&#8217;s address into the box and submitting that. You will be given a send-to address, with which to deposit into your account.</p>
<p>Be sure to deposit a bit more than you plan to spend on your first order, due to the tendency of the price of bitcoin to fluctuate/sway heavily at certainly random times (+there are no deposit fees, but there are transaction fees for the blockchain). Once you&#8217;ve deposited your first bitcoin into your Outlaw Market account it takes a few confirmations on the blockchain for it to display as part of your wallet-balance. Be patient, normally speaking. Regardless, if it takes unusually too long such as more than twenty-four hours, contact the staff, as explained earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Ordering:</strong></p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve finally deposited some funds, it is time to buy that item you truly want.</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/lst1.png">

<p>In the dropdown box displayed above, select the amount of this item you desire (for this example we&#8217;re going to choose only 1). Add it to your shopping cart and check-out:</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/check1.png">

<p>You&#8217;re brought to this screen, where you confirm once again:</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/Untitled201509131427521.jpg">

<p>After you&#8217;ve click “Order,” you should enter your shipping address or other appropriate data in its place (encrypted). If you are buying a digital item, as we, in fact, are, there is no need for a shipping address, and even encryption is trivial, at that. Ensure you have filled out everything correctly, and confirm your purchase as seen in the screenshot below:</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/unt21.jpg">

<p><strong>Statuses Explained:</strong></p>
<p>Once the vendor marks the order as having been shipped, the item needs to be finalized from this screen (which can be loaded by click the &#8216;Orders&#8217; link at the top of the website in the top-bar), the same place from which you can also cancel your order, prior to your vendor&#8217;s approval:</p>

<img src="https://G-I-R.github.io/deepdotweb/imgs/2015/09/ORD1.png">

<p>If your order is not delivered in the appropriate time as mentioned in the listing, circumstances considered, you may dispute the order while it is still inside of Escrow.</p>
<p><strong>Receiving:</strong></p>
<p>If you get something in the postal mail which you do not recognize, don&#8217;t simply throw it away, gung-ho. Most vendors have really good stealth which leads to some buyers disposing of their packages, thought to have been spam. Once your package has in fact been successfully delivered, confirm you&#8217;ve received your order alright, in the page linked from the shopping-cart clip-art as explained earlier. After you have finally done this, your funds will be released from escrow to your vendor. If you don&#8217;t do this, then you&#8217;ll need to standby for Auto-finalize to happen.</p>
<p>If you end up not receiving what you have actually ordered, or it had been tardy, feel free to message your vendor. They are typically quite helpful, if you stay calm and collective. If one of your encountered issues is not properly fixed by the vendor, open a dispute. Once that dispute has been opened, and you&#8217;re contacted by an assigned staff member, try to remember that senselessly attacking either the moderator or the vendor, can lose you the dispute-case.</p>
<p>If you are a satisfied-or-otherwise patron, remember to leave feedback, either positive or negative. Easily the most important component of the darkweb industry is its rating system.</p>
<p><strong>Part 9 – Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>If you follow these guidelines, you should be safe buying. There&#8217;s plenty more to learn, but you&#8217;re better learning it for yourself. Super-safe shopping!</p>
