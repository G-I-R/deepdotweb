<p>According to a report translated from <a href="http://www.zataz.com/infiltration-dans-le-blackmarket-francophone/">Zataz.com</a> magazine (Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/Schmittounet">@Schmittounet</a> for the translation!):</p>
<blockquote><p>If you don&#8217;t want your databases to be leaked, release publicly who is the moleskin at your place.</p></blockquote>
<p>With these few lines, an anonymous darkweb hacker announced that he has his hand on several databases of french darkweb sites.</p>
<blockquote><p>Friends from FDW, I have ALL databases</p></blockquote>
<p>Said the blackmailer. To prove his infiltration, the hacker explained he obtained access to all internals and privates messages of staff members from these french onion sites: FDW (French Darkweb), FDP (French Dark Place), FDW-Market and Zangdar, and also databases of The French Hidden Wiki and some vendor shops like: chris_carter; walterwhite; raol; youryorlov75; texas.</p>

<blockquote><p>« How can you stay trustworthy and manage this crappy place of pedophile »</p></blockquote>
<p>Said the hacker. If this is true, this will be gold for authorities.</p>
<blockquote><p>I will contact you soon with some proofs to negotiate, but right now the hunting season is open.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hacker summarized.</p>
<p>According to the report &#8211; <a href="http://www.zataz.com/infiltration-dans-le-blackmarket-francophone/">ZATAZ.COM</a> were been able to access to some presumed proofs: screenshots from a privates messages section which belongs to one of the blackmarket admins.</p>
<p>DeepDotWeb were not able to verify if these claims are indeed real &#8211; but able to confirm that some of these alleged hacked markets has been down for the past few days according to our stats.</p>
