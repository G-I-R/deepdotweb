<p><strong>Update 12.10.15</strong>: Source code is now available for download at <a href="http://www.f-a-i.net/download/fai_v1.0.0_src.zip">this link</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Note</strong>:  Source files are still not available for review at this time, according to the system developer &#8220;To avoid Alt-coining, source code will be published after its user number reaches 1000&#8221;.  so proceed with caution if you want to test this system and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_%28software_development%29">use sandbox</a>.</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Introduction post about &#8220;Φ &#8221; provided by its developer:</strong></p>
<p><em>What can blockchain technology d</em><em>o </em><em>besides decentralized currency system or decentralized contract system? </em></p>
<p><em>A decentralized content sharing system</em><em>:</em> <a href="http://www.f-a-i.net"><strong>F</strong><strong>ree </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>nonymous Internet</strong> <strong>Φ</strong></a><em>!</em></p>
<p>Φ is a decentralized peer-to-peer content sharing system. Empowered by Blockchain technology, Φ shows some unprecedented advantages:</p>
<p><strong>Ultimate Freedom</strong>: content can NEVER be deleted, locked, modified or censored. Once published it is accessible from anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Ultimate Anonymity</strong>: No real world personal data needed. Footprint is untraceable.</p>
<h2>Main Functions</h2>
<p><strong>Publish and Browse</strong></p>
<p>A content field is added to transaction output in Φ system, enabling contents published to Φ blockchain.</p>
<p>Publishing contents on Φ does not need any registration as you normally do with a centralized website or mobile app. Contents are uncensored. No one can delete or modify (including the publisher) once the content is confirmed by Φ network.</p>
<p>All information on Φ blockchain is public to every Φ browser. To browse on Φ, you will not leave any trace on what information you’ve browsed because every peer has a full copy of the whole block chain.</p>

<p>Since every piece of content has a publisher address (Public-key), following and tipping the poster or commenting to the content is available. In personal homepage, all contents published by an address are listed, which works as a decentralized Facebook or twitter.</p>

<p><strong>Messenger</strong></p>
<p>Anonymous encrypted chatting is enabled by sending contents encrypted by a shared-key derived from sender and receiver’s keys. Since the message is relayed by the Φ network, there’s no direct connection between sender and receiver. Meanwhile, similar to publishing contents, to send or receive message on Φ system doesn’t require registration, so Φ messenger keeps the highest possible anonymity.</p>

<p><strong>Shop</strong></p>
<p>Φ shop is the first one in history that carries the information flow and cash flow in the same system. With the same Φ account, you may publish any product, receive order, and even receive payment in real time.</p>

<p><strong>Domain</strong></p>
<p>Φ domain is similar to ICANN domains, but without any central registrar. Φ domain has more freedom and flexibility: it can be redirected to a Φ ID, a Φ link or even a normal http link. With a domain, avatar, alias and intros can be set to an account which is way cuter than messy addresses.</p>

<p><strong>Wallet</strong></p>
<p>With a free automatically generated Φ account on the first start, you may already receive Φ coins from others. In Φ wallet, there are basic functions for balance and transaction history.</p>

<p><strong>Mine coins</strong></p>
<p>By contributing computing power to help confirming transaction on Φ network, miner will receive transaction fee as incentive.</p>

<p><strong>Internet browsing</strong></p>
<p>Standard web browser function is integrated in Φ system. You may simply use Φ as a normal browser.</p>

<p><strong>Other innovative functions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Weighted Multisig:</strong> Multisig is enhanced by adding signature weight to each address.</p>
<p><strong>Blockchain link:</strong> A link pointing to any content on blockchain, identified by block height, nTx and nVout.</p>
<p><strong>Vout locktime:</strong> Each vout has individual locktime.</p>
<p><strong>Mempool entrance threshold:</strong> when mempool is full, an entrance threshold of fee rate will be enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Mempool tx override:</strong> When a tx is stuck in mempool without enough fee to be collected in new blocks, sender or receiver may add fee and override the old tx.</p>
<p><strong>Off-chain service:</strong> More centralized service such as offchain instant messenger and cloud storage can be developed in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>New POW Hashing Algorithm:</strong> A new algorithm incompatible with Bitcoin or Litecoin ASICs.</p>
<p><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p>Φ system is designed with an Infrastructure-API-Applications framework. This framework enables plug-n-play of unlimited new applications. Serverless dynamic websites becomes possible: the Φ Browser, Φ Messenger and Φ Shop are all good examples.</p>

<h2>Where to find?</h2>
<p>Official website: <a href="http://www.f-a-i.net/">www.f-a-i.net</a></p>
<p>Currently a windows version is available for downloading. To avoid Alt-coining, source code will be published after its user number reaches 1000.</p>
<p>Promotion is going on: send your Φ address to <a href="mailto:fai03a6@gmx.com">fai03a6@gmx.com</a> to get free 10 Φ coins which allows you to publish 10KB long content to Φ blockchain.</p>
