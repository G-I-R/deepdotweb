<p>Provided by <a href="https://gir.pub/deepdotweb/?s=Doctor+X">Doctor X</a> &amp; &#8220;<a href="http://energycontrol.org/international.html">International Drug Testing Service </a>from <a href="http://www.energycontrol.org">Energy Control</a> which in collaboration with <a href="http://www.asud.org/">ASUD</a> and <a href="http://www.technoplus.org/">TechnoPlus</a>, has recently analyzed heroin samples (nº3, for smoking and nº4 intranasal/intravenous). We have been informed that <strong>these samples were delivered through Deep Web Marketplaces</strong> and offered from Europe (big sellers from France and Belgium).</p>
<p>In April 2015, in Belgium, a young man died after taking a brown powder he had bought on the deep web and actually <a href="http://www.eurotox.org/images/stories/docs/AlertePDF/ews%202015%2007%2004%20-%20ocfentanil.pdf">was ocfentanyl</a>. In their June&#8217;s newsletter, the British harm reduction project Wedinos said they had already analyzed six samples of <a href="http://www.wedinos.org/resources/downloads/Philtre_Issue_6.pdf">ocfentanyl powder</a>.</p>
<p>These samples were suspicious for adulteration, and this idea has been confirmed. Analysis results shows ocfentanyl presence, a synthetic opioid which is hundred times more potent than heroin. Effects are similar to other opiates, but this adulteration can increase overdose and severe adverse effects risks. Overdose-related fentanyl and fentanyl derivatives from opiate samples, have been recently reported in United States, Canada and Europe.</p>
<p>Energy Control warns heroin users who buy this product from Deep Web. There are no quick or qualitative tests for fentanyl and fentanyl derivatives. The only way to know the exact composition of a drug is submitting a sample to analysis.
