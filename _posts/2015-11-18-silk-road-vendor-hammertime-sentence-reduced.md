<p><a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2015/11/global_silk_road_meth_dealer_f.html#incart_story_package">Jason Weld Hagen from Vancouver, AKA. Hammertime, said to be the biggest meth vendor on the most infamous ex-dark net market, has been sentenced to a much lighter time, 37 months, followed by five years of court supervision, instead of a life sentence.</a> According to law enforcement authorities, Hagen and his gang sold drugs on the dark web worth the total sum of $607,000.</p>
<p>We wrote some articles regarding this case, if you are interested then kindly visit <a href="https://gir.pub/deepdotweb/?s=hammertime">this link</a>.</p>
<p>A sentencing memo describing Hagen’s activities goes by:</p>
<p>&#8220;During this time, Hagen, as Hammertime, engaged in approximately 3,169 transactions on Silk Road, selling roughly 17.6 pounds of methamphetamine. He and his coconspirators sold the drug in small increments, typically a half-gram at a time, often hiding them inside DVD cases labeled, ’South Beach Workout’.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A wide variety of goods, mostly illegal, were sold on the site, including false and stolen identities, hacking tools, counterfeit goods, pirated media, criminal guidebooks, money laundering services, and murder for hire contracts.&#8221;</p>
<p>After he pleaded before Portland District Court, there was a huge possibility that the prosecutors will follow on with a life sentence in prison, however, something has interrupted the case. A corrupt DEA and a Secret Service Agent had stood before the court and pleaded guilty for making $1 million from extortion cases. The former agents&#8217; cases were only peripherally connected to Hagen, however, their crimes would play a major role in his punishment.</p>
<p>After Silk Road has been seized, federal agents across the globe had busted several vendors of the former dark net market, including Hammertime. Agent Shaun Bridges, the disgraced member of the Secret Service has been part of the raid team when Hagen’s bust took place. When the US. Attorneys have heard that the corrupt agent was involved in the bust, they recommended a lighter sentence to the judge. The man got 3 years and seven months, instead of a rough six years in prison. Not just Hagen had his sentence reduced, but the ones he worked alongside doing their drug business on the dark net.</p>
<p>Judge Jones was not happy with the sentence Hagen got. He ended the man’s trial with this statement:</p>
<p>Your crimes were egregious,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to give you credit because the government messed up.&#8221;</p>
