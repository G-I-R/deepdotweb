<p><a href="http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/363444/students-arrested-raids">Two Otago University students (aged 23) have been arrested for importing drugs from dark net markets and selling them on the streets.</a> The police raid was a part of a joint action called Operation Albany, which was conducted at two properties located in the university area of Dunedin on November 16. The two drug-dealing students were granted name suppression by court after being charged with importing and supplying drugs from the dark web.</p>
<p>As part of the raid, at one address the police found around $18,000 in cash, as well as quantities of cocaine, ecstasy, LSD and prescription medicine packaged for sale on the street, Detective Senior Sergeant Malcolm Inglis stated.</p>
<p>&#8221;They were all made up in small amounts ready for sale.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that the raid was followed by drug seizures at the border of New Zealand. The two students (at the address where the drugs were found) has been charged with the importing of illegal substances from the dark web, however, the additional charge of selling these drugs is being investigated by the local law enforcement authorities. Detective Inglis made this statement regarding the sale of the drugs:</p>
<p>“Police believed the pair were linked to drug dealing among the student community and believed drugs imported by the pair had already hit the street. We would imagine that a quantity of drugs has reached the street at some stage. We believe [the cash] to be &#8230; linked to drug dealing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roger Batten, customs investigations operations manager stated that the customs in the country are making the catching of the drugs at the border their first priority and will continue to work closely with police in order to &#8221;prevent these harmful substance reaching our communities&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8221;Students using the internet to import drugs should be warned that their actions are not anonymous and there are consequences which could affect their future careers and travel plans,&#8221; Batten said.</p>
<p>Detective Inglis said that importing Class A and B drugs from the dark web is a dangerous thing to do for the students, and they are gambling with their lives on this matter.</p>
<p>&#8221;These types of drugs are illegal for a reason, and they can cause serious harm to those who end up using them. We are disappointed that another group of students appear to be involved in the dark web and the importation of illegal drugs. It&#8217;s another very sad occurrence. We have these very bright young people going on to the dark web believing they can be involved in this activity unaware of the devastation it will have on their futures.&#8221;</p>
<p>This wasn’t the only case where university students were caught importing illegal substances from dark net markets in New Zealand. You can check all the cases <a href="https://gir.pub/deepdotweb/?s=dunedin">at this link</a>. Inglis said this regarding the case:</p>
<p>&#8221;We would rather see them qualify and finish at university and not finish by appearing in front of the courts.”</p>
<p>&#8221;This is a national problem, not just an Otago University problem. It&#8217;s happening across the country at all universities. People think they can make easy money.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two students are attending their court hearing today.</p>
