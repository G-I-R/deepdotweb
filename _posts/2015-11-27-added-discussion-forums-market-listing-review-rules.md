<p>Just to update several small but important updates on the site:</p>
<ol>
<li>Started listing non-commercial darknet discussion forums, from now on they will be shown <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2013/10/28/updated-llist-of-hidden-marketplaces-tor-i2p/">on the markets list</a> and on the sidebar:<br/>

<li>Added to important documents to try and clarify those things once and for all:<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">For market admins &amp; vendors</span>: <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/rules-for-market-vendor-shops-listing/">Market &amp; Vendor Shops Listing Rules</a> (on the markets list, and will be sent to any admin / vendor requesting to get listed).<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">For users</span>: <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/rules-for-posting-market-reviews/">Rules for Posting Market Reviews</a>, visible on the markets list and to anyone before submitting a review:<br/>
