<p>Hours after <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/12/bitcoins-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-is-probably-this-unknown-australian-genius/" target="_blank">Wired</a> &amp; <a href="http://gizmodo.com/this-australian-says-he-and-his-dead-friend-invented-bi-1746958692?rev=1449615811696" target="_blank">Gizmodo</a> magazines claimed bitcoin was created by an &#8220;unknown Australian genius&#8221; called Craig Wright, his home is raided.</p>

<p class="story__intro">Police have raided the Sydney home of a man named as the likely creator of cryptocurrency bitcoin, according to the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-bitcoin-exclusive-idUSKBN0TS0AB20151209" target="_blank">Reuters news agency</a>.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s code was released in 2009 under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto, and journalists and investors have been trying to track down the creator ever since.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon around a dozen federal police officers raided the house after a locksmith broke open the door &#8211; just hours after Wired magazine named Craig Wright as the man responsible for bitcoin.</p>
<p>A Reuters reporter said officers told them that police were &#8220;clearing the house&#8221;.</p>

<p>However the police force said in a statement that the move was not linked to &#8220;media reporting &#8230; about bitcoins&#8221;.</p>
<p>Instead it directed all inquiries to the Australian Tax Office, suggesting the raid could be linked to tax issues.</p>
<p>Wired magazine said their own investigations showed that Mr Wright was probably the secretive bitcoin creator.</p>
<p>They cited leaked emails, documents and archives from the Dark Web.</p>
<p>However, the magazine said their proof was not conclusive: &#8220;Despite a massive trove of evidence, we still can&#8217;t say with absolute certainty that the mystery is solved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he&#8217;s a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several publications have previously attempted to guess Nakamoto&#8217;s real identity, but no claims have proven conclusive.</p>
<p>The creator of bitcoin has around a million of them, worth more than £250m at current exchange rates.</p>
<p>Since its launch, bitcoin has grown from a digital novelty to a currency with a total value of around £3.3bn.</p>
<p><strong>On The Trail Of Bitcoin&#8217;s Alleged Founder</strong></p>
<p>After receiving a trove of leaked documents which allegedly linked Craig Wright to bitcoin, Wired magazine sent him an email saying they knew his secret.</p>
<p>He replied: &#8220;You are digging, the question is how deep are you? Regards, the Director of Tessier-Ashpool&#8221;</p>
<p>The name is a cyberpunk reference to William Gibson’s Sprawl trilogy.</p>
<p>A few hours later a follow-up message arrived: &#8220;The nature of this moniker is selected for a purpose. I now have resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;This makes me a we now. I am still within that early phase of learning just what my capabilities happen to be. So, even now with resources I remain vulnerable. You seem to know a few things. More than you should.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Wired described the connections they had found, he replied: &#8220;Although we all desire some level of credit, I have moved past many of these things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too many already know secrets, the world does not need to know. There are other means to lead change than to be a dictator.&#8221;</p>
<p>He eventually said he would consider a request for a meeting, before ending all contact.</p>
