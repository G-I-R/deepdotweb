<p>Luckily, we have found out that HideIPVPN is offering a promotional $0.99 monthly fee on all their subscription plans and packages. Thus, to be able to help you guys, we took time to take a look at what HideIPVPN has to offer by conducting a comprehensive review of their VPN network services and features, so that you and the rest of our readers will have the necessary information to decide on whether or not HideIPVPN is the right VPN service provider for you.</p>
<p>
<p>To begin the review, let us take a look at some of the information and facts that we have gathered about their company.</p>
<h3>About the Company</h3>
<p>HideIPVPN is a company that aims to provide users around the world with an affordable and first class VPN and SmartDNS service. Their company was established on September 2009 by its CEO and founder Adrian Crismaru. Their objective was to provide a way for all people to have access to a strong online protection, so that everyone can enjoy the freedom to express themselves on the internet.</p>
<p>HideIPVPN is made up of 9 VPN servers in the US, 8 VPN servers in the UK, 5 VPN servers in Netherlands, 3 VPN servers in Germany, 2 VPN servers in Canada and 1 VPN server in Poland.</p>
<p>At present, the company conducts their operations at their head office located at 1201 N Orange St Wilmington, Delaware in the USA.</p>

This onetime, limited free trial offer allows users to connect to all HideIVPN servers in the United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Germany and Poland.</p>
<p>Additionally, they also offer a 7 days Free SmartDNS access on their premium servers and a 30 days money back guarantee on all new subscriptions. However, they do not process any refunds on speed issues, because their free trial service already allows users to test the speed of their VPN service before purchasing any subscription plans and packages.</p>
<p>To avail of HideIPVPN’s free trial offer, just click the TRY VPN FOR FREE button found in their website and then enter your first name, last name and email address on their Register Free VPN trial account page.</p>

<h2>Interface and Setup &#8211; HideIPVPN</h2>
<p>HideIPVPN’s client software is easy to download and install. You can access their client software installer through the link button that they include in the email notification that they send when you register for their free trial service, or you can download it by clicking on the Support tab on their website.</p>
<h3>Downloading and Installing the HideIPVPN Software</h3>
<p>For this review, we used a device running on Windows platform and opted to download their VPN software through their website.</p>
<p>After choosing the HideIPVPN Software tab on their support page, we clicked on the DOWNLOAD button and waited for the download process to finish.</p>
<p>
<p>After the download was complete, we ran the software installer and clicked on the Next button, and then the I Agree button to start the installation.</p>
<p>
<p>We selected which components to install and then clicked on the Next button.</p>
<p>
<p>We entered the destination folder where the files would be saved and then clicked on the Install button.</p>
<p>The software installed the initial files and then displayed a dialogue box that asked us if we wanted to install TAP-Windows Provider V9 Network adapter. We clicked on the install button to proceed with the installation. We waited for the setup process to end and then we clicked on the Finish button to complete the installation.</p>
<h3>Connecting to the HideIPVPN network</h3>
<p>After the setup process was complete, their software automatically ran and displayed their VPN login screen in our device.</p>
<p>
<p>We entered our username and password on the fields provided and then clicked on the SIGN IN button to continue.</p>
<p>We were directed to their VPN connection screen, where we selected the protocol and the VPN server that we wanted to connect to on their VPN network.</p>
<p>
<p>We clicked on the CONNECT button and waited for the software to connect us to the VPN network.</p>
<p>
<p>After a few seconds, the status was changed to Connected, informing us that we were able to successfully connect to their VPN service.</p>
<p>HideIPVPN’s client software is so easy to use. It even allowed us to change our preferred network settings and use their Application Killer feature quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>
<p>
<h2>Security –HideIPVPN</h2>
<p>HideIPVPN protects its subscribers by allowing them to use any of the multiple encryption protocols that they provide in their VPN service, which includes OpenVPN (128-bit encryption), SSTP (256-bit encryption), L2TP/IPSec (256-bit encryption), PPTP (128-bit encryption) and SoftEther (128-bit encryption).</p>
<p>The variety of the protocols that HideIPVPN offers to their users allows their VPN service to be flexible against different security threats and attacks, making them one of the most secured VPN service providers in the market today.</p>
<h3>Privacy –HideIPVPN</h3>
<p>HideIPVPN does not keep any server log records. However, they do store the name, billing details and other personally identifiable information of their users. Plus, they may request a proof of identity from users that are suspicious or those that register from high risk countries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, HideIPVPN is based in the US, which is under the DCMA jurisdiction. This makes it harder to avoid any DCMA claims and disputes.</p>
<p>Moreover, they do not provide any Transparency Reports that may warn their users of any complains that were made against them.</p>

<h2>Speed – HideIPVPN</h2>
<p>
<p>During our speed test review for HideIPVPN, we didn’t notice any lags and latency issues on their network. In fact, HideIPVPN did better that most VPN service providers out there in the market today, because during our entire speed test review on their network, they only averaged a 7% drop on speed, which is quite good in terms of VPN connection speed.</p>
<h2>Usability – HideIPVPN</h2>
<p>Overall, HideIPVPN gets an A grade from us in terms of usability. Everything is done fast and easily. Downloading and installing HideIPVPN’s client software is a breeze. Their website even provides a step by step instruction on how to setup and install their client software.</p>
<p>Furthermore, HideIPVPN allows you to connect up to 3 devices on their network simultaneously. Plus, their Application Killer feature provides users with the peace of mind that they need, because it can automatically close selected applications whenever their VPN connection is accidentally disconnected.</p>
<p>Though, we have observed one negative aspect about their VPN network, which is the limited number of VPN servers available. It would have been great, if there were more location options to connect to.</p>
