<p>&#8220;Hello Avengers! We have some more exciting news for you!</p>
<p>We have recently reached out to Energy Control and they have been very welcoming of our initiative.</p>
<p>We are now offering the ability to pay Energy Control directly, without any up-front payment from our members, or reimbursement.</p>
<p>That means that all you need is an envelope/package, a pill/blotter/microdot, or 50mg of powder and the proper international stamp to send a letter/package to Spain!</p>
<p>We are extremely excited to announce this and we&#8217;re sure that it means more users sending in tests since they don&#8217;t have to pay up-front.</p>
<p>You will find the updated detailed instructions here:</p>
