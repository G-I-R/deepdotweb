<p><strong>#4th Update on Nucleus</strong>: Seems to be back up: <a href="#">Nucleus Market</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#3rd Update on Nucleus</strong>: &#8220;We have answered some questions about unaccessible accounts on the Support, but server will stay offline for next 5 &#8211; 9 hours due to preparations for relaunch.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>#2nd Update on <strong>Nucleus</strong></strong>: &#8220;We are still investigating the problem. Server should be back online yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update on Nucleus</strong> <strong>homepage</strong>&#8211; Please hold until everything is confirmed as fixed (if at all):</p>

<p>======End of update====</p>
<p>During the past 24 hours we had multiple reports from vendors being locked out of their accounts on nucleus market, <a href="https://g-i-r.github.io/deepdotweb/2015/11/16/solved-these-are-the-most-popular-dark-net-markets/">which is (or was?) the second largest market currently</a>, there reports were posted on <a href="#">such as this one</a>.Â  During this time buyer withdrawals seemed to be unaffected. Currently the market seems to be down:</p>

<p>It is not yet clear if this is yet another (totally unsurprising) exit scam in our even growing list of exit scammers or some technical issue. We&#8217;ll be following and updating when / if we will have any new info. So far there were no reported updates from the admins.</p>
<p>Either way, if it goes back up &#8211; you should avoid any deposits to the market until the issues with the locked out vendors are cleared.</p>
<p>Until then, remember, exit scams are part of the dark net markets game, here are some alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li class="ok"><strong><a href="#">AlphaBay</a></strong></li>
<li class="ok"><strong><a href="#">Dream market </a></strong></li>
<li class="ok"><strong><a href="#"> Outlaw Market</a></strong></li>
<li class="ok"><strong><a href="#">Valhalla (Silkkitie)</a></strong></li>
<li class="ok"><strong><a href="#">Hansa Market</a></strong></li>
<li class="ok"><strong><a href="#">Python Market</a></strong></li>
<li class="ok"><strong><a href="#">Acropolis Market</a></strong></li>
<li class="ok"><strong><a href="#">Dr. D&#8217;s Multilingual Market </a></strong></li>
<li class="ok"><strong><a href="#">ACAS Market</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Currently uptime issues are also being reported on Cryuserv which is hosting several vendor shops.</p>
<p>Since Agora was shut down, it became the season of exit scams when, as expected, the next &#8220;default&#8221; markets in line took advantage of the massive agora refugees traffic and exit scammed. So far we had Abraxas and middle earth, maybe now Nucleus? who will be next&#8230; only time will tell.</p>
